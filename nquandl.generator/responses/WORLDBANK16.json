Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nCereal production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-10T03:02:05.980Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:46:18.274Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:46:18.274Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":207295,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEL_GER_SEC_GPI_GENR_ZS","name":"Belgium: GPI for gross enrollment rate,secondary","urlize_name":"Belgium-GPI-for-gross-enrollment-rate-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEL/indicators/GER.SEC.GPI.GENR.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"GPI for gross enrollment rate, secondary is gender parity index (ratio of female to male) of the gross enrollment ratio.\nGPI for gross enrollment rate,secondary","created_at":"2012-01-02T20:02:11.539Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:41:42.116Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":188120,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARE_SL_UEM_PRIM_MA_ZS","name":"United Arab Emirates: Unemployment with primary education, male (% of male unemployment)","urlize_name":"United-Arab-Emirates-Unemployment-with-primary-education-male-of-male-unemployment","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARE/indicators/SL.UEM.PRIM.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Unemployment by level of educational attainment shows the unemployed by level of educational attainment, as a percentage of the unemployed.

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:22:41.349Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:33:49.414Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:33:49.414Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6535533,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRQ_IC_FRM_INNOV_T2","name":"Iraq: Percent of firms with an annual financial statement reviewed by external auditors","urlize_name":"Iraq-Percent-of-firms-with-an-annual-financial-statement-reviewed-by-external-auditors","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRQ/indicators/IC.FRM.INNOV.T2?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms with an annual financial statement reviewed by external auditors.

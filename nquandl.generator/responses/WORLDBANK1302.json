The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end.

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-06T00:49:35.748Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:27.050Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:27.050Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6598056,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PER_WP11655_4","name":"Peru: Loan from an informal private lender in the past year, young adults (% ages 15-24)","urlize_name":"Peru-Loan-from-an-informal-private-lender-in-the-past-year-young-adults-ages-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PER/indicators/WP11655.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a private lender (including informal money lenders) (% ages 15-24)\nLoan from an informal private lender in the past year, young adults (% ages 15-24)","created_at":"2013-05-21T12:05:26.451Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:12:11.484Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:12:11.484Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":507024,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MLI_IC_FRM_LBSK_ZS","name":"Mali: Labor skill level (% of firms identifying this as a major constraint)","urlize_name":"Mali-Labor-skill-level-of-firms-identifying-this-as-a-major-constraint","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MLI/indicators/IC.FRM.LBSK.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of firms identifying labor skills as a major constraint.

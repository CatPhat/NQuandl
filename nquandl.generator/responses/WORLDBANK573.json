This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Divisionâ€™s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mineâ€™s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:17:40.913Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:15:50.078Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:15:50.078Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":216699,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BGD_GER_PRI_POP_ATTN_6064_MA","name":"Bangladesh: Population by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 60-64)","urlize_name":"Bangladesh-Population-by-educational-attainment-primary-male-aged-60-64","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BGD/indicators/GER.PRI.POP.ATTN.6064.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 60-64) is the total number of males age 60-64 with primary education.\nPopulation by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 60-64)","created_at":"2012-01-02T23:15:52.689Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:42:44.142Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":415245,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_SE_COM_DURS","name":"Kenya: Duration of education, compulsory","urlize_name":"Kenya-Duration-of-education-compulsory","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/SE.COM.DURS?per_page=1000","description":"Duration of compulsory education is the number of years that children are legally obliged to attend school.\nDuration of education, compulsory","created_at":"2012-01-07T09:56:38.957Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T04:55:41.409Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T04:55:41.409Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2199239,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JAM_UIS_REPP_23_GPV_G6_M","name":"Jamaica: Percentage of repeaters in secondary.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:05:46.637Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:56:38.493Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:56:38.493Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6498337,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COD_WP11652_2","name":"Congo, Dem.

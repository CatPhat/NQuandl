When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process. The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.\nCO2 emissions from cement production (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:32:24.425Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:59.044Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:59.044Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":342244,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GMB_SE_TER_GRAD_FE_SS_ZS","name":"Gambia, The: Female share of graduates in social science, business and law (%, tertiary)","urlize_name":"Gambia-The-Female-share-of-graduates-in-social-science-business-and-law-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GMB/indicators/SE.TER.GRAD.FE.SS.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Female share of graduates in social science, business and law (%, tertiary)\nFemale share of graduates in social science, business and law (%, tertiary)","created_at":"2012-01-05T23:00:01.204Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:53:50.714Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:53:50.714Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2108486,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUN_BAR_SCHL_5054_FE","name":"Tunisia: average years of total schooling, 50-54, female","urlize_name":"Tunisia-average-years-of-total-schooling-50-54-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUN/indicators/BAR.SCHL.5054.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of total schooling, 50-54, female is the average years of education completed among females age 50-54. \naverage years of total schooling, 50-54, female","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:44:15.963Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:13:13.115Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:13:13.115Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6481783,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUN_GFDD_SI_04","name":"Tunisia: Bank credit to bank deposits (%)","urlize_name":"Tunisia-Bank-credit-to-bank-deposits","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUN/indicators/GFDD.SI.04?per_page=1000","description":"Raw data are from the electronic version of the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-04T14:06:53.209Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:28:43.945Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:28:43.945Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2188613,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_WP11623_4_10","name":"Georgia: Account at a formal financial institution, rural (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Georgia-Account-at-a-formal-financial-institution-rural-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/WP11623_4.10?per_page=1000","description":"Adults with an account (self or together with someone else) at a bank, credit union, another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives, microfinance institutions) or the post office (if applicable) including respondents who reported having a debit card (% living in an urban area, age 15+ )\nAccount at a formal financial institution, rural (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:28:55.262Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:34:39.057Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:34:39.057Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2189067,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TJK_DT_AMT_PUBS_19_24_MO_CD","name":"Tajikistan: 066_T2_Public Sector, Principal, 19 to 24 Months","urlize_name":"Tajikistan-066_T2_Public-Sector-Principal-19-to-24-Months","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TJK/indicators/DT.AMT.PUBS.19.24.MO.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n066_T2_Public Sector, Principal, 19 to 24 Months","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:31:23.598Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T10:58:27.828Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T10:58:27.828Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2011-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2283265,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_WP11648_2","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Saved at a financial institution in the past year, male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Saved-at-a-financial-institution-in-the-past-year-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/WP11648.2?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved or set aside any money in the past 12 months using an account at a bank, credit union or another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives) or microfinance institution (% male, age 15+)\nSaved at a financial institution in the past year, male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T12:52:42.082Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:04:53.199Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:04:53.199Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6504637,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"YEM_DT_TDS_DECT_10_12_MO_CD","name":"Yemen, Rep.: 053_T2_Total Debt Service, 10 to 12 Months","urlize_name":"Yemen-Rep-053_T2_Total-Debt-Service-10-to-12-Months","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/YEM/indicators/DT.TDS.DECT.10.12.MO.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n053_T2_Total Debt Service, 10 to 12 Months","created_at":"2013-05-16T02:03:18.735Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T11:01:10.526Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T11:01:10.526Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-06-30","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2273709,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BGR_WP11655_7","name":"Bulgaria: Loan from an informal private lender in the past year, secondary education or more (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Bulgaria-Loan-from-an-informal-private-lender-in-the-past-year-secondary-education-or-more-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BGR/indicators/WP11655.7?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a private lender (including informal money lenders) (% with a secondary education or more, age 15+)\nLoan from an informal private lender in the past year, secondary education or more (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T11:49:08.760Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:23:01.797Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:23:01.797Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2279173,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GNB_UIS_E_23_GPV_G4","name":"Guinea-Bissau: Enrolment in secondary.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. Principal repayments are actual amounts of principal (amortization) paid by the borrower in foreign currency, goods, or services in the year specified.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:48:09.422Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:37:27.948Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:37:27.948Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7843753,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_272SERBIA1755ALLGHGANIMALSTOTAL","name":"Emissions Agriculture Manure Left on Pasture: All GHG Animals + (Total) - Serbia","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Manure-Left-on-Pasture-All-GHG-Animals-Total-Serbia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Manure_left_on_pasture_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T07:12:17.315Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:03:00.690Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:03:00.690Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2001-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7700899,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_96CHINAHONGKONGSAR1182HONEYNATURAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Honey, natural - China, Hong Kong SAR","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Honey-natural-China-Hong-Kong-SAR","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T19:43:52.422Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T19:14:58.346Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-11T19:14:58.346Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7649066,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_236VENEZUELABOLIVARIANREPUBLICOF290SESAMEOIL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Sesame oil - Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Sesame-oil-Venezuela-Bolivarian-Republic-of","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent.

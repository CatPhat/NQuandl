A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-05T21:49:57.504Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:44:12.219Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:44:12.219Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2033998,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ESP_WP11651_4","name":"Spain: Loan from a financial institution in the past year, young adults (% ages 15-24)","urlize_name":"Spain-Loan-from-a-financial-institution-in-the-past-year-young-adults-ages-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ESP/indicators/WP11651.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a bank, credit union or another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives) or microfinance institution (% ages 15-24)\nLoan from a financial institution in the past year, young adults (% ages 15-24)","created_at":"2012-08-06T19:31:24.800Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.226Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.226Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2091177,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BLR_WP11674_11","name":"Belarus: Mobile phone used to receive money , urban (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Belarus-Mobile-phone-used-to-receive-money-urban-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BLR/indicators/WP11674.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a mobile phone to receive money in the past 12 months (% living in a rural area, age 15+)\nMobile phone used to receive money , urban (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:06:58.660Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:19:51.112Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:19:51.112Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2184197,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MRT_WP11655_1","name":"Mauritania: Loan from an informal private lender in the past year (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Mauritania-Loan-from-an-informal-private-lender-in-the-past-year-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MRT/indicators/WP11655.1?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a private lender (including informal money lenders) (% age 15+)\nLoan from an informal private lender in the past year (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:03:31.332Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:32.901Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:32.901Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":416823,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KNA_TM_TAX_MANF_SR_ZS","name":"St. Kitts and Nevis: Share of tariff lines with specific rates, manufactured products (%)","urlize_name":"St-Kitts-and-Nevis-Share-of-tariff-lines-with-specific-rates-manufactured-products","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KNA/indicators/TM.TAX.MANF.SR.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Share of tariff lines with specific rates is the share of lines in the tariff schedule that are set on a per unit basis or that combine ad valorem and per unit rates.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

Quintile 1 is the number of quintile 1 children in the official primary school age range who are not attending primary or secondary education, expressed as a percentage of quintile 1 children of the official primary school age range. By definition, children in the official primary-age range, who are attending pre-primary education, are considered out-of-school. The sum of the net primary attendance rate and the proportion out of school do not add to 100 percent because the net primary attendance rate does not count students who are in secondary.\nDHS: Proportion of out-of-school.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\nNet bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Belgium (current US$)","created_at":"2012-08-09T02:18:13.307Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:53:24.392Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:53:24.392Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2004-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2127825,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_WP11648_9","name":"Sierra Leone: Saved at a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Sierra-Leone-Saved-at-a-financial-institution-in-the-past-year-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLE/indicators/WP11648.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved or set aside any money in the past 12 months using an account at a bank, credit union or another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives) or microfinance institution (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nSaved at a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:21:48.424Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:09:52.506Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:09:52.506Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6617247,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_UIS_FTP_2","name":"Rwanda: Percentage female teachers.

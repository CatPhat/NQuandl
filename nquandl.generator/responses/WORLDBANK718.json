Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.

That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Commitments Index, all service sectors (0 least liberal to 100 most liberal)","created_at":"2012-01-02T20:21:15.029Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T04:52:15.182Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T04:52:15.182Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":368995,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_DT_DOD_DECT_CD_FF_TO","name":"Croatia: 397_T2.1_Gross External Debt Foreign Currency and Foreign-Currency-Linked (FCFCL) (Total)","urlize_name":"Croatia-397_T2-1_Gross-External-Debt-Foreign-Currency-and-Foreign-Currency-Linked-FCFCL-Total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/DT.DOD.DECT.CD.FF.TO?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n397_T2.1_Gross External Debt Foreign Currency and Foreign-Currency-Linked (FCFCL) (Total)","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:55:19.425Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T21:18:15.559Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T21:18:15.559Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-03-31","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":519384,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MRT_GB_RVK_TOTL_CN","name":"Mauritania: Capital revenue (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Mauritania-Capital-revenue-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MRT/indicators/GB.RVK.TOTL.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Capital revenue comprises proceeds from the sale of nonfinancial capital assets, including land, intangible assets, stocks, and fixed capital assets of buildings, construction and equipment of more than a minimum value and usable for more than one year in the process of production, and receipts of unrequited transfers for capital purposes from nongovernmental sources.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2013-05-18T07:11:58.035Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:35:41.296Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:35:41.296Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2218476,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LUX_UIS_E_1_G3","name":"Luxembourg: Enrolment in primary.

Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T14:06:51.966Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:23:52.640Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:23:52.640Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price (LCU/tonne) (LCU)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7740596,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_153NEWCALEDONIA234NUTSNES","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Nuts, nes - New Caledonia","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Nuts-nes-New-Caledonia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

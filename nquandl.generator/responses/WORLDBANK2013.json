GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-03T23:06:37.584Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:18.402Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:18.402Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1982-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":376937,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IND_SP_POP_AG06_MA_UN","name":"India: Population, aged  6, male","urlize_name":"India-Population-aged-6-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IND/indicators/SP.POP.AG06.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 6, male refers to the male population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged  6, male","created_at":"2012-01-06T16:13:30.356Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:18.535Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:18.535Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":306781,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_DT_AXR_OFFT_CD","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Principal rescheduled, official (current US$)","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Principal-rescheduled-official-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/DT.AXR.OFFT.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Principal rescheduled is the amount of principal due or in arrears that was rescheduled in any given year.

It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.

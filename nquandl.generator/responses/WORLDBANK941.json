Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2013-05-21T04:41:59.618Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:55:43.138Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:55:43.138Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":423487,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KOR_MYS_POP_15UP_TER_MA","name":"Korea, Rep.: population in thousand, 15+, male, tertiary","urlize_name":"Korea-Rep-population-in-thousand-15-male-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KOR/indicators/MYS.POP.15UP.TER.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15+, male, tertiary is the total number of males over age 15 (in thousands) with tertiary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15+, male, tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-07T13:52:27.658Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:55:42.541Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:55:42.541Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":367851,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_BAR_SEC_CMPT_3539_ZS","name":"Croatia: percentage of population (15+), 35-39, total, completed secondary","urlize_name":"Croatia-percentage-of-population-15-35-39-total-completed-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/BAR.SEC.CMPT.3539.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 35-39, total, completed secondary is the percentage of people age 35-39 who have completed secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 35-39, total, completed secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:25:36.640Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:00:26.613Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:00:26.613Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2286005,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"WSM_UIS_NE_1_G1_F","name":"Samoa: New entrants to Grade 1 of primary education.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-03-05T11:09:32.611Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:10:23.477Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:10:23.477Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":261295,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COD_SH_DYN_AIDS_LW_ZS","name":"Congo, Dem.

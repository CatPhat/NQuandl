Tariff line data were matched to Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) revision 3 codes to define commodity groups. Effectively applied tariff rates at the six- and eight-digit product level are averaged for products in each commodity group. When the effectively applied rate is unavailable, the most favored nation rate is used instead. To the extent possible, specific rates have been converted to their ad valorem equivalent rates and have been included in the calculation of simple mean tariffs. Primary products are commodities classified in SITC revision 3 sections 0-4 plus division 68 (nonferrous metals).\nTariff rate, applied, simple mean, primary products (%)","created_at":"2012-01-07T04:11:08.589Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:48:27.830Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:48:27.830Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1988-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6491355,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_SH_STA_OWGH_MA_ZS","name":"Uganda: Prevalence of overweight, male (% of children under 5)","urlize_name":"Uganda-Prevalence-of-overweight-male-of-children-under-5","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/SH.STA.OWGH.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Prevalence of overweight, male (% of children under 5)\nPrevalence of overweight, male (% of children under 5)","created_at":"2013-05-15T12:19:09.743Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:03:01.902Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:03:01.902Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1988-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":532238,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NPL_SL_TLF_0714_WK_FE_ZS","name":"Nepal: Children in employment, work only, female (% of female children in employment, ages 7-14)","urlize_name":"Nepal-Children-in-employment-work-only-female-of-female-children-in-employment-ages-7-14","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NPL/indicators/SL.TLF.0714.WK.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Children in employment refer to children involved in economic activity for at least one hour in the reference week of the survey.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region.

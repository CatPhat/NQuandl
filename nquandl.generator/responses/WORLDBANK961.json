The HDI is the geometric mean of the three dimension indices and embodies imperfect substitutability across all HDI dimensions.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients.

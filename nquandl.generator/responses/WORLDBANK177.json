Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process. The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.\nCO2 emissions from cement production (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:37:04.718Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:11:48.438Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:11:48.438Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6571761,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MUS_GCI_PILLAR11TO12_XQ","name":"Mauritius: Innovation and sophistication factors (weighted index 11th pillar to 12 th pillar)","urlize_name":"Mauritius-Innovation-and-sophistication-factors-weighted-index-11th-pillar-to-12-th-pillar","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MUS/indicators/GCI.PILLAR11TO12.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"The innovation and sophistication factors subindex includes the pillars (pillar 11 and 12) critical to countries in the innovation-driven stage.  \nInnovation and sophistication factors (weighted index 11th pillar to 12 th pillar)","created_at":"2013-05-20T14:36:33.930Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:50:32.861Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:50:32.861Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6467571,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TGO_AG_CRP_MLT_CD","name":"Togo: Producer Price for Millet (per tonne, current US$)","urlize_name":"Togo-Producer-Price-for-Millet-per-tonne-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TGO/indicators/AG.CRP.MLT.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Producer prices are prices received by farmers for primary agricultural products as defined in the SNA 93.

Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

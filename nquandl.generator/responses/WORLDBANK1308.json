Primary is the number of female teachers at the primary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the primary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nPrimary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-08-06T20:13:03.385Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:57:11.876Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:57:11.876Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2001-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6448046,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SWE_BAR_PRM_SCHL_6064_FE","name":"Sweden: average years of primary schooling, 60-64, female","urlize_name":"Sweden-average-years-of-primary-schooling-60-64-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SWE/indicators/BAR.PRM.SCHL.6064.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of primary schooling, 60-64, female is the average years of primary education completed among females age 60-64. \naverage years of primary schooling, 60-64, female","created_at":"2013-05-14T13:23:26.141Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:51:50.148Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:51:50.148Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":405027,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_SH_MMR_WAGE_ZS","name":"Kenya: Maternal leave benefits (% of wages paid in covered period)","urlize_name":"Kenya-Maternal-leave-benefits-of-wages-paid-in-covered-period","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/SH.MMR.WAGE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Maternal leave benefits (% of wages paid in covered period)\nMaternal leave benefits (% of wages paid in covered period)","created_at":"2012-01-07T06:28:14.812Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:32:12.796Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:32:12.796Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2122065,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRL_WP11631_3_1","name":"Ireland: Retail store is main mode of deposit into account (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Ireland-Retail-store-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRL/indicators/WP11631.3.1?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is over the counter at a retail store (% age 15+, with a formal account)\nRetail store is main mode of deposit into account (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:53:25.560Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:54:49.086Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:54:49.086Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":204431,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEL_SP_POP_AG25_FE_IN","name":"Belgium: Age population, age 25, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Belgium-Age-population-age-25-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEL/indicators/SP.POP.AG25.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 25, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-01-02T18:35:49.785Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:04:17.432Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:04:17.432Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6567127,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MMR_UIS_OAPP_1_F","name":"Myanmar: Over-age enrolment ratio.

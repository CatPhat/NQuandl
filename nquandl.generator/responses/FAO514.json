The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:01:01.316Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:54:52.140Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:54:52.140Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7778346,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_86GRENADA2804RICEPADDYEQUIVALENT","name":"Commodity Balances Crops: Rice (Paddy Equivalent) - Grenada","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Crops-Rice-Paddy-Equivalent-Grenada","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form. The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-02T18:38:39.107Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T08:01:54.603Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T08:01:54.603Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Waste (tonnes)","Food (tonnes)","Other Util (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7799497,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_108KAZAKHSTAN2570OILCROPSOTHER","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Oilcrops, Other - Kazakhstan","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Oilcrops-Other-Kazakhstan","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T10:53:57.060Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:36:43.459Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:36:43.459Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7665876,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_256LUXEMBOURG2041CROPSPINTOTAL","name":"Value of Production: Crops (PIN) + (Total) - Luxembourg","urlize_name":"Value-of-Production-Crops-PIN-Total-Luxembourg","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Value_of_Production_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

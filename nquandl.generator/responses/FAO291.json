The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-03T17:58:42.067Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T06:59:51.106Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T06:59:51.106Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Other Util (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7720413,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_64FAROEISLANDS664COCOABUTTER","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cocoa Butter - Faroe Islands","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cocoa-Butter-Faroe-Islands","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T18:19:35.581Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:14.482Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:14.482Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7750349,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5302EASTERNASIATOTAL664COCOABUTTER","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cocoa Butter - Eastern Asia + (Total)","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cocoa-Butter-Eastern-Asia-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961. These estimates are provided by countries through an annual survey conducted by FAO Forestry Department in partnership with the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources. Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:52:22.616Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:33:29.236Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:33:29.236Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (m3)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7784687,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_134MALTA2625FRUITSOTHER","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Fruits, Other - Malta","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Fruits-Other-Malta","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T14:10:11.232Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:09:59.429Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:09:59.429Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false}],"sources":[{"id":863,"code":"FAO","datasets_count":192278,"description":"Comprehensive global data on food and agriculture.

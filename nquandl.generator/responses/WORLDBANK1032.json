Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Primary is the number of female teachers at the primary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the primary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nPrimary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-08-09T00:04:04.294Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T05:03:30.840Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T05:03:30.840Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2236725,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VNM_BAR_SCHL_3034","name":"Vietnam: average years of total schooling, 30-34, total","urlize_name":"Vietnam-average-years-of-total-schooling-30-34-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/VNM/indicators/BAR.SCHL.3034?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of total schooling, 30-34, total is the average years of education completed among people age 30-34. \naverage years of total schooling, 30-34, total","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:01:56.146Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:54:30.661Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:54:30.661Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2116349,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRL_WP11654_7","name":"Ireland: Loan from an employer in the past year, secondary education or more (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Ireland-Loan-from-an-employer-in-the-past-year-secondary-education-or-more-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRL/indicators/WP11654.7?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from an employer (% with a secondary education or more, age 15+)\nLoan from an employer in the past year, secondary education or more (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:25:26.957Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:31:58.868Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:31:58.868Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2241458,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAK_BAR_PRM_ICMP_4549_ZS","name":"Pakistan: percentage of population (15+), 45-49, total, incomplete primary","urlize_name":"Pakistan-percentage-of-population-15-45-49-total-incomplete-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAK/indicators/BAR.PRM.ICMP.4549.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 45-49, total, incomplete primary is the percentage of the population age 45-49 who did not complete primary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 45-49, total, incomplete primary","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:32:08.524Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:12:25.765Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:12:25.765Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2087899,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUN_SE_PRM_CMPL_MA_ZS","name":"Tunisia: Gross primary graduation ratio, male","urlize_name":"Tunisia-Gross-primary-graduation-ratio-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUN/indicators/SE.PRM.CMPL.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Gross primary graduation ratio.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes.

Definitions for each indicator follow.  Total debt service (TDS) shows the debt service payments on total long-term debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of IMF credit, and interest on short-term debt only. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments in the year specified.  Exports of goods, services and income is the sum of goods (merchandise) exports, exports of (nonfactor) services and income (factor) receipts.  Data are in current U.S. dollars.  Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices.

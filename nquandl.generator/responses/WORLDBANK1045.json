The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.\nGross non-food production index (1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:00:35.337Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:03:47.075Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:03:47.075Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2153061,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZWE_MYS_PROP_4564_SEC_MA","name":"Zimbabwe: proportion, 45-64, male, secondary","urlize_name":"Zimbabwe-proportion-45-64-male-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZWE/indicators/MYS.PROP.4564.SEC.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 45-64, male, secondary is the proportion of the male population age 45-64 with secondary education.\nproportion, 45-64, male, secondary","created_at":"2012-08-08T23:31:43.684Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:34:48.153Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:34:48.153Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6595989,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PER_SE_SEC_PROG_MA_ZS","name":"Peru: Progression to secondary school, male (%)","urlize_name":"Peru-Progression-to-secondary-school-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PER/indicators/SE.SEC.PROG.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Transition from primary (ISCED 1) to secondary (ISCED 2), general programmes (%).

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

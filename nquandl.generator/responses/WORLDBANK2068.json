This item includes principal repayments on long-term debt and IMF repurchases. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents by residents of an economy and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services. IMF repurchases are total repayments of outstanding drawings from the General Resources Account during the year specified, excluding repayments due in the reserve tranche. To maintain comparability between data on transactions with the IMF and data on long-term debt, use of IMF credit outstanding at the end of year (stock) is converted to dollars at the SDR exchange rate in effect at the end of year. Repurchases (flows) are converted at the average SDR exchange rate for the year in which transactions take place. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\nPrincipal repayments on external debt, long-term + IMF (AMT, current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-02T18:08:42.440Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:30.434Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:30.434Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":369433,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HTI_SP_POP_1218_MA_UN","name":"Haiti: Population, aged 12-18, male","urlize_name":"Haiti-Population-aged-12-18-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HTI/indicators/SP.POP.1218.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12-18, male is the total number of males age 12-18.\nPopulation, aged 12-18, male","created_at":"2012-01-06T13:05:53.172Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:30.447Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:30.447Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":412156,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KHM_TM_VAL_MRCH_R4_ZS","name":"Cambodia: Merchandise imports from developing economies in Middle East & North Africa (% of total merchandise imports)","urlize_name":"Cambodia-Merchandise-imports-from-developing-economies-in-Middle-East-North-Africa-of-total-merchandise-imports","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KHM/indicators/TM.VAL.MRCH.R4.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Merchandise imports from developing economies in Middle East and North Africa are the sum of merchandise imports by the reporting economy from developing economies in the Middle East and North Africa region according to the World Bank classification of economies.

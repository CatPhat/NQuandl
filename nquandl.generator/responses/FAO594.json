Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T14:26:09.182Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:41:27.570Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:41:27.570Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7838076,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_124LIBYA1302TRACTORSAGRICTOTAL","name":"Investment Machinery Archive: Tractors Agric Total - Libya","urlize_name":"Investment-Machinery-Archive-Tractors-Agric-Total-Libya","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Investment_MachineryArchive_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Investment Domain in FAOSTAT includes: Capital stock, External assistance to agriculture, Machinery.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:16:51.555Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:36:43.258Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:36:43.258Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)","Import Quantity (Kg)","Export Quantity (Kg)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7786020,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_229UNITEDKINGDOM2561SESAMESEED","name":"Commodity Balances Crops: Sesameseed - United Kingdom","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Crops-Sesameseed-United-Kingdom","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Commitments Index, all service sectors (0 least liberal to 100 most liberal)","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:13:25.910Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:38:51.411Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:38:51.411Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2092739,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AZE_SA_CT_CDG_CI","name":"Azerbaijan: Concentration index - Cash Transfer","urlize_name":"Azerbaijan-Concentration-index-Cash-Transfer","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AZE/indicators/sa_ct.cdg_ci?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Concentration index for Cash Transfer\nConcentration index - Cash Transfer","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:16:34.144Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T17:42:31.603Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T17:42:31.603Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":274264,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COM_IC_LGL_HIRE_XQ","name":"Comoros: Employing workers, difficulty of hiring index","urlize_name":"Comoros-Employing-workers-difficulty-of-hiring-index","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COM/indicators/IC.LGL.HIRE.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"\nEmploying workers, difficulty of hiring index","created_at":"2012-01-04T11:51:29.221Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:48:13.733Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":434475,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LBR_GB_GRT_KFRN_CN","name":"Liberia: External capital grants (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Liberia-External-capital-grants-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LBR/indicators/GB.GRT.KFRN.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Grants are unrequited, nonrepayable, noncompulsory receipts of government from other governments or international institutions.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-02T15:50:10.937Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:09:17.805Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:09:17.805Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6464712,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BIH_SA_OCT_COV_Q2","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina: (%) Program participation by 2nd 20%  -  Family/Child allowances","urlize_name":"Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Program-participation-by-2nd-20-Family-Child-allowances","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BIH/indicators/sa_oct.cov_q2?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the (%) Program participation by 2nd 20% population for Family/Child allowances\n(%) Program participation by 2nd 20%  -  Family/Child allowances","created_at":"2013-05-14T20:07:52.043Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T21:59:41.856Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T21:59:41.856Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":411386,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KGZ_DT_NFL_IFAD_CD","name":"Kyrgyz Republic: Net official flows from UN agencies, IFAD (current US$)","urlize_name":"Kyrgyz-Republic-Net-official-flows-from-UN-agencies-IFAD-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KGZ/indicators/DT.NFL.IFAD.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Net official flows from UN agencies are the net disbursements of total official flows from the UN agencies.

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.

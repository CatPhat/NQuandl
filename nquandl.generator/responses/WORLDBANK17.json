Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-04T11:22:17.006Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:04:11.179Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:04:11.179Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6454156,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SWE_WP11654_11","name":"Sweden: Loan from an employer in the past year, urban (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Sweden-Loan-from-an-employer-in-the-past-year-urban-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SWE/indicators/WP11654.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from an employer (% living in a rural area, age 15+)\nLoan from an employer in the past year, urban (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-14T14:37:32.187Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:59:02.202Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:59:02.202Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":304708,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ECU_BAR_PRM_CMPT_4549_ZS","name":"Ecuador: percentage of population (15+), 45-49, total, completed primary","urlize_name":"Ecuador-percentage-of-population-15-45-49-total-completed-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ECU/indicators/BAR.PRM.CMPT.4549.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 45-49, total, completed primary is the percentage of people age 45-49 who have completed primary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 45-49, total, completed primary","created_at":"2012-01-05T04:17:47.816Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:58:58.283Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:58:58.283Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2232426,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLV_WP11671_11","name":"El Salvador: Outstanding loan for funerals or weddings, urban (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"El-Salvador-Outstanding-loan-for-funerals-or-weddings-urban-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLV/indicators/WP11671.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out for funerals or weddings (% living in a rural area, age 15+)\nOutstanding loan for funerals or weddings, urban (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:39:15.851Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:06:09.978Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:06:09.978Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2031206,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GBR_UIS_XNATURCP_1_FDPUB_FNTS","name":"United Kingdom: Percentage distribution of public current expenditure by purpose in primary education.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations includes the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA).

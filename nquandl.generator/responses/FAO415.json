The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T12:27:46.549Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:55:07.728Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:55:07.728Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7832351,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_13BAHRAIN3010POPULATIONESTPROJ","name":"Population: Population - Est. & Proj. - Bahrain","urlize_name":"Population-Population-Est-Proj-Bahrain","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Population_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The annual series of demographic estimates, which are stored in this domain, consist of the following: total population by sex, urban and rural population, agricultural and non-agricultural population (AP and NON-AP), total economically active population or labour force (EAP) by sex, and economically active population (or labour force) in agriculture (EAPA) by sex.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:37:04.958Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:50:51.081Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:50:51.081Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2049-12-31","column_names":["Year","Total Population - Both sexes (1000)","Total Population - Male (1000)","Total Population - Female (1000)","Rural population (1000)","Urban population (1000)","Agricultural population (1000)","Non-agricultural population (1000)","Total economically active population (1000)","Male economically active population (1000)","Female economically active population (1000)","Total economically active population in Agr (1000)","Male economically active population in Agr (1000)","Female economically active population in Agr (1000)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7635711,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_58ECUADOR497LEMONSANDLIMES","name":"Prices Indices: Lemons and limes - Ecuador","urlize_name":"Prices-Indices-Lemons-and-limes-Ecuador","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Price_Indices_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:19:36.310Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:51:49.680Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:51:49.680Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7862698,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5105WESTERNAFRICATOTAL1660UNBLEACHEDSULPHITEPULP","name":"Forestry: Unbleached Sulphite Pulp - Western Africa + (Total)","urlize_name":"Forestry-Unbleached-Sulphite-Pulp-Western-Africa-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T14:37:18.257Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T00:03:21.311Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T00:03:21.311Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7689249,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_58ECUADOR1953CASSAVAEQUIVALENTTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cassava Equivalent + (Total) - Ecuador","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cassava-Equivalent-Total-Ecuador","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

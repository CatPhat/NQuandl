In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:25:30.359Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T00:17:28.851Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T00:17:28.851Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7656309,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_109JAMAICA1025GOATSKINS","name":"Production Livestock Primary: Goatskins - Jamaica","urlize_name":"Production-Livestock-Primary-Goatskins-Jamaica","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Production_LivestockPrimary_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:01:33.976Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:14:52.965Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:14:52.965Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Non-fertilizer use (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7847294,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_129MADAGASCAR1651INDRWDWIRC","name":"Forestry: Ind Rwd Wir (C) - Madagascar","urlize_name":"Forestry-Ind-Rwd-Wir-C-Madagascar","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper. For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961.

In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T21:48:13.916Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:37:25.958Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:37:25.958Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7715056,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_225UNITEDARABEMIRATES1274OILBOILEDETC","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Oil Boiled Etc - United Arab Emirates","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Oil-Boiled-Etc-United-Arab-Emirates","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T20:37:52.594Z","updated_at":"2014-01-10T14:15:40.390Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-10T14:15:40.390Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7728779,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_134MALTA79MILLET","name":"Prices Archive: Millet - Malta","urlize_name":"Prices-Archive-Millet-Malta","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/PricesArchive_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:38:09.443Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:34:34.738Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:34:34.738Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (m3)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (m3)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7809020,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_59EGYPT3103PHOSPHATEFERTILIZERSP205TOTALNUTRIENTS","name":"Resources Fertilizers: Phosphate Fertilizers (P205 total nutrients) - Egypt","urlize_name":"Resources-Fertilizers-Phosphate-Fertilizers-P205-total-nutrients-Egypt","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Fertilizers_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:12:18.411Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T00:08:46.668Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T00:08:46.668Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7641338,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_68FRANCE507GRAPEFRUITINCPOMELOS","name":"Prices Indices: Grapefruit (inc. pomelos) - France","urlize_name":"Prices-Indices-Grapefruit-inc-pomelos-France","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Price_Indices_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

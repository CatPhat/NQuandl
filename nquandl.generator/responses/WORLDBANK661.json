'Private' refers to all educational institutions not operated by a public authority, regardless of whether they receive financial support from public authorities. A high percentage indicates strong involvement of the non-governmental sector (including religious bodies, other organizations, associations, communities, private enterprises or persons) in providing organized educational programmes.\nSchool enrollment, secondary, private (% of total secondary)","created_at":"2012-03-05T13:15:27.379Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:01:55.989Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:01:55.989Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6462544,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SYR_SP_POP_AG19_MA_IN","name":"Syrian Arab Republic: Age population, age 19, male, interpolated","urlize_name":"Syrian-Arab-Republic-Age-population-age-19-male-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SYR/indicators/SP.POP.AG19.MA.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, male refers to male population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 19, male, interpolated","created_at":"2013-05-14T19:25:53.696Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:06:18.432Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:06:18.432Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2091523,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LAO_BAR_PRM_CMPT_7074_FE_ZS","name":"Lao PDR: percentage of population (15+), 70-74, female, completed primary","urlize_name":"Lao-PDR-percentage-of-population-15-70-74-female-completed-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LAO/indicators/BAR.PRM.CMPT.7074.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 70-74, female, completed primary is the percentage of females age 70-74 who have completed primary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 70-74, female, completed primary","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:09:25.198Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T22:46:46.497Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T22:46:46.497Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2261170,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TTO_NY_ADJ_DKAP_GN_ZS","name":"Trinidad and Tobago: Adjusted savings: consumption of fixed capital (% of GNI)","urlize_name":"Trinidad-and-Tobago-Adjusted-savings-consumption-of-fixed-capital-of-GNI","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TTO/indicators/NY.ADJ.DKAP.GN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Consumption of fixed capital represents the replacement value of capital used up in the process of production.\nAdjusted savings: consumption of fixed capital (% of GNI)","created_at":"2012-08-09T10:35:52.645Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:01:49.863Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:01:49.863Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2051422,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COD_WP11648_11","name":"Congo, Dem.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

Generally, â€˜literacyâ€™ also encompasses â€˜numeracyâ€™, the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100. \nLiteracy rate, adult total (% of people ages 15 and above)","created_at":"2013-05-13T20:34:20.030Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:08:49.717Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:08:49.717Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":261032,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_BAR_TER_SCHL_1519_FE","name":"Cameroon: average years of tertiary schooling, 15-19, female","urlize_name":"Cameroon-average-years-of-tertiary-schooling-15-19-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/BAR.TER.SCHL.1519.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of tertiary schooling, 15-19, female is the average years of tertiary education completed among females age 15-19. \naverage years of tertiary schooling, 15-19, female","created_at":"2012-01-04T06:32:57.846Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:50:20.027Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:50:20.027Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":228247,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BLR_GC_TAX_YPKG_RV_ZS","name":"Belarus: Taxes on income, profits and capital gains (% of revenue)","urlize_name":"Belarus-Taxes-on-income-profits-and-capital-gains-of-revenue","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BLR/indicators/GC.TAX.YPKG.RV.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains are levied on the actual or presumptive net income of individuals, on the profits of corporations and enterprises, and on capital gains, whether realized or not, on land, securities, and other assets.

When data on number of tourists are not available, the number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members, is shown instead.

The indicator is based on UNESCOâ€™s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

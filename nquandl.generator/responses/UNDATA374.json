In addition to different methodologies, different series numbers are used when data are reported in different currencies, fiscal years, or by different sources. Furthermore, data are stored under a new series number whenever there are significant changes in compilation practices which make the time series no longer comparable.","created_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:50.635Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:50.836Z","refreshed_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:50.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","General public services","Defence","Economic affairs","Housing and community amenities","Health","Recreation; culture and religion","Education","Social protection","Equals: General government final consumption expenditure","Public order and safety"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":11298718,"source_id":5449,"source_code":"UNDATA","code":"IFS_DC_CLI_BTN","name":"Depository Corporations - Capital Liabilities - Bhutan","urlize_name":"Depository-Corporations-Capital-Liabilities-Bhutan","display_url":null,"description":"Depository Corporations Survey/Monetary Survey - Capital And Unclassified Liabilities.

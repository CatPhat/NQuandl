Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Accordingly, the coverage of portfolio investment differs in these regards from the coverage of bank claims, which include indistinguishably export credit lending by banks. The bank claims data represent the net change in banks’ claims after adjustment to eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates. They are therefore a proxy for net flow data, but are not themselves a net flow figure. They differ in two further regards from other OECD data.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Disbursements are drawings on loan commitments during the year specified.  \nDisbursements, Bilateral on nonconcessional terms (DIS, current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-05T21:13:11.576Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:25:37.789Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:25:37.789Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2006-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2213150,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVK_WP11628_2_9","name":"Slovak Republic: 1-2 deposits into account in a typical month, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Slovak-Republic-1-2-deposits-into-account-in-a-typical-month-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVK/indicators/WP11628.2.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make 1-2 deposits into their personal account(s) in a typical month.

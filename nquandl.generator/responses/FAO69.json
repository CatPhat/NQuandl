Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:07:18.426Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T21:47:03.663Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T21:47:03.663Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7699766,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_115CAMBODIA572AVOCADOS","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Avocados - Cambodia","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Avocados-Cambodia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

Denominator: Estimated number of HIV-infected pregnant women in the last 12 months.  Ranges are presented for countries with low and concentrated epidemics.  The purpose of this indicator is to assess progress in preventing vertical transmission of HIV.  All data reflect values representing 12 month period ending December 2007 which have been reconciled between reporting country and UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF, unless otherwise noted.  All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

Female is the percentage of females age 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. Generally, ‘literacy’ also encompasses ‘numeracy’, the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of female literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100. \nLiteracy rate, adult female (% of females ages 15 and above)","created_at":"2012-01-02T14:05:55.428Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:23:10.422Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:23:10.422Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1989-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6425196,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SEN_GC_TAX_OTHR_RV_ZS","name":"Senegal: Other taxes (% of revenue)","urlize_name":"Senegal-Other-taxes-of-revenue","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SEN/indicators/GC.TAX.OTHR.RV.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Other taxes include employer payroll or labor taxes, taxes on property, and taxes not allocable to other categories, such as penalties for late payment or nonpayment of taxes.\nOther taxes (% of revenue)","created_at":"2013-05-13T21:36:39.422Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:22:39.736Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:22:39.736Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":188805,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARE_BAR_SEC_CMPT_7074_ZS","name":"United Arab Emirates: percentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, completed secondary","urlize_name":"United-Arab-Emirates-percentage-of-population-15-70-74-total-completed-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARE/indicators/BAR.SEC.CMPT.7074.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 70-74, total, completed secondary is the percentage of people age 70-74 who have completed secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, completed secondary","created_at":"2012-01-02T10:38:15.775Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:22:40.718Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:22:40.718Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":311836,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ERI_DC_DAC_BELL_CD","name":"Eritrea: Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Belgium (current US$)","urlize_name":"Eritrea-Net-bilateral-aid-flows-from-DAC-donors-Belgium-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ERI/indicators/DC.DAC.BELL.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC).

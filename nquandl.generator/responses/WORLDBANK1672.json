Data are classified using the Harmonized System of trade at the six- or eight-digit level. Tariff line data were matched to Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) revision 3 codes to define commodity groups and import weights. To the extent possible, specific rates have been converted to their ad valorem equivalent rates and have been included in the calculation of weighted mean tariffs. Import weights were calculated using the United Nations Statistics Division's Commodity Trade (Comtrade) database. Effectively applied tariff rates at the six- and eight-digit product level are averaged for products in each commodity group. When the effectively applied rate is unavailable, the most favored nation rate is used instead. Primary products are commodities classified in SITC revision 3 sections 0-4 plus division 68 (nonferrous metals).\nTariff rate, applied, weighted mean, primary products (%)","created_at":"2012-08-08T14:20:23.400Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:49:02.171Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:49:02.171Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2130054,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TZA_BAR_TER_CMPT_1519_ZS","name":"Tanzania: percentage of population (15+), 15-19, total, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"Tanzania-percentage-of-population-15-15-19-total-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TZA/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.1519.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 15-19, total, completed tertiary is the percentage of people age 15-19 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 15-19, total, completed tertiary","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:31:44.971Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:16:35.864Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:16:35.864Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2178910,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JOR_UIS_LR_AG65","name":"Jordan: Elderly (65+) literacy rate (%).

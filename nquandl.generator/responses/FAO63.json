Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:17:32.891Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:58:17.250Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:58:17.250Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)","Import Quantity (Kg)","Export Quantity (Kg)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7631739,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_4ALGERIA463VEGETABLESFRESHNES","name":"Prices Archive: Vegetables fresh nes - Algeria","urlize_name":"Prices-Archive-Vegetables-fresh-nes-Algeria","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/PricesArchive_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-09T06:33:12.057Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:53:11.693Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:53:11.693Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":367391,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HND_MYS_POP_4549_NED_MF","name":"Honduras: population in thousand, 45-49, total, no education","urlize_name":"Honduras-population-in-thousand-45-49-total-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HND/indicators/MYS.POP.4549.NED.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 45-49, total, no education is the total number of people age 45-49 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 45-49, total, no education","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:13:52.967Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:05.902Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:05.902Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2113536,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NGA_MYS_PROP_6064_SEC_MF","name":"Nigeria: proportion, 60-64, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Nigeria-proportion-60-64-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NGA/indicators/MYS.PROP.6064.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 60-64, total, secondary is the proportion of the population age 60-64 with secondary education.\nproportion, 60-64, total, secondary","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:10:17.663Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:03.426Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:03.426Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2222536,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEX_WP11636_3","name":"Mexico: Account used to receive remittances , female (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Mexico-Account-used-to-receive-remittances-female-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MEX/indicators/WP11636.3?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a formal account in the past 12 months to receive money from family members living elsewhere (% female, age 15+)\nAccount used to receive remittances , female (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T06:41:17.446Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:34:38.240Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:34:38.240Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":269305,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COL_BAR_POP_25UP","name":"Colombia: population in thousands (age 15+), 25+, total","urlize_name":"Colombia-population-in-thousands-age-15-25-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COL/indicators/BAR.POP.25UP?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousands, 25+, total is the total population over age 25 in thousands estimated by Barro-Lee.\npopulation in thousands (age 15+), 25+, total","created_at":"2012-01-04T09:37:19.041Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:00:45.462Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:00:45.462Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":368612,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HND_SE_PRM_TENR","name":"Honduras: Adjusted net enrollment rate, primary (% of primary school age children)","urlize_name":"Honduras-Adjusted-net-enrollment-rate-primary-of-primary-school-age-children","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HND/indicators/SE.PRM.TENR?per_page=1000","description":"Adjusted net enrollment is the number of pupils of the school-age group for primary education, enrolled either in primary or secondary education, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group.\nAdjusted net enrollment rate, primary (% of primary school age children) ","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:43:54.356Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:06:48.368Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:06:48.368Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1978-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6594777,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PER_MYS_POP_3034_TER_FE","name":"Peru: population in thousand, 30 -

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end.

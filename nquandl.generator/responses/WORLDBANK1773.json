Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five or more years for forage, including natural and cultivated crops.\nAgricultural land (sq. km)","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:32:28.109Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:17:37.484Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:17:37.484Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2144658,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZAF_FM_AST_NFRG_CN","name":"South Africa: Net foreign assets (current LCU)","urlize_name":"South-Africa-Net-foreign-assets-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZAF/indicators/FM.AST.NFRG.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Net foreign assets are the sum of foreign assets held by monetary authorities and deposit money banks, less their foreign liabilities.

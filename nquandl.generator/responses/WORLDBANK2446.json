It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:58:03.733Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:13:32.858Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:13:32.858Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6544296,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KNA_BN_FIN_TOTL_CD","name":"St. Kitts and Nevis: Net financial account (BoP, current US$)","urlize_name":"St-Kitts-and-Nevis-Net-financial-account-BoP-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KNA/indicators/BN.FIN.TOTL.CD?per_page=1000","description":"The net financial account shows net acquisition and disposal of financial assets and liabilities.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity.

A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nGINI index","created_at":"2012-01-09T08:49:43.423Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:36:38.726Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:36:38.726Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1985-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2211358,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLV_MYS_POP_65UP_TER_MF","name":"El Salvador: population in thousand, 65+, total, tertiary","urlize_name":"El-Salvador-population-in-thousand-65-total-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLV/indicators/MYS.POP.65UP.TER.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 65+, total, tertiary is the total number of people over age 65 (in thousands) with tertiary education.\npopulation in thousand, 65+, total, tertiary","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:36:44.644Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:09:51.113Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:09:51.113Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":475685,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEX_DT_DOD_DSTO_CD_CB","name":"Mexico: 032_T1_Gross External Debt, Other.debt.liabilities (ST, Banks)","urlize_name":"Mexico-032_T1_Gross-External-Debt-Other-debt-liabilities-ST-Banks","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MEX/indicators/DT.DOD.DSTO.CD.CB?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n032_T1_Gross External Debt, Other.debt.liabilities (ST, Banks)","created_at":"2012-01-10T13:34:39.041Z","updated_at":"2014-08-26T23:19:20.660Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-26T23:19:20.660Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2002-03-31","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":439747,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LKA_SH_STA_BRTW_ZS","name":"Sri Lanka: Low-birthweight babies (% of births)","urlize_name":"Sri-Lanka-Low-birthweight-babies-of-births","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LKA/indicators/SH.STA.BRTW.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"UNICEF, State of the World's Children, Childinfo, and Demographic and Health Surveys by ICF International.\nLow-birthweight babies (% of births)","created_at":"2012-01-09T08:44:42.783Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:37:59.191Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:37:59.191Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6606386,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PNG_SH_STA_OW15_FE_ZS","name":"Papua New Guinea: Prevalence of overweight, female (% of female population ages 15+)","urlize_name":"Papua-New-Guinea-Prevalence-of-overweight-female-of-female-population-ages-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PNG/indicators/SH.STA.OW15.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Prevalence of overweight (% of population ages 15+), female\nPrevalence of overweight, female (% of female population ages 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-21T14:03:48.397Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:29:58.948Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:29:58.948Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2002-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6565370,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MKD_UIS_T_23_GPV","name":"Macedonia, FYR: Teaching staff in total secondary.

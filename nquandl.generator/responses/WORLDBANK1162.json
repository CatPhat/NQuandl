A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-06T20:26:35.303Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:42.179Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:42.179Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2054354,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"QAT_LO_TIMSS_SCI8_FE","name":"Qatar: TIMSS:Mean performance on the science scale  for eighth grade students, female","urlize_name":"Qatar-TIMSS-Mean-performance-on-the-science-scale-for-eighth-grade-students-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/QAT/indicators/LO.TIMSS.SCI8.FE?per_page=1000","description":"TIMSS: Mean performance on the science scale for eighth grade students, female\nTIMSS:Mean performance on the science scale  for eighth grade students, female","created_at":"2012-08-07T20:17:23.098Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:03:21.026Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:03:21.026Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":219313,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BHR_TX_VAL_FOOD_ZS_UN","name":"Bahrain: Food exports (% of merchandise exports)","urlize_name":"Bahrain-Food-exports-of-merchandise-exports","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BHR/indicators/TX.VAL.FOOD.ZS.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Food comprises the commodities in SITC sections 0 (food and live animals), 1 (beverages and tobacco), and 4 (animal and vegetable oils and fats) and SITC division 22 (oil seeds, oil nuts, and oil kernels).\nFood exports (% of merchandise exports)","created_at":"2012-01-03T00:11:21.900Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:32:26.091Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:32:26.091Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2132363,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_SP_POP_BRTH_MF","name":"Sierra Leone: Sex ratio at birth (males per female)","urlize_name":"Sierra-Leone-Sex-ratio-at-birth-males-per-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLE/indicators/SP.POP.BRTH.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Sex ratio at birth (males per female)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:43:46.693Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:14:41.279Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:14:41.279Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1962-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6615569,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_REM_AVT_POP","name":"Rwanda: Beneficiaries' per capita transfer -  Private Transfers","urlize_name":"Rwanda-Beneficiaries-per-capita-transfer-Private-Transfers","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RWA/indicators/rem.avt_pop?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Beneficiaries' per capita transfer for Private Transfers \nBeneficiaries' per capita transfer -  Private Transfers ","created_at":"2013-05-22T01:03:03.349Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T22:17:21.523Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T22:17:21.523Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6513432,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_UIS_FOSEP_56_F400","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Percentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in science","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Percentage-of-tertiary-enrolments-ISCED-5-and-6-in-science","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/UIS.FOSEP.56.F400?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in science is the percentage of all tertiary students who are enrolled in science programmes.\nPercentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in science","created_at":"2013-05-16T17:05:49.884Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:07:53.958Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:07:53.958Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2035818,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LAO_IC_FRM_OBS_OBST2","name":"Lao PDR: Percent of firms choosing access to land as their biggest obstacle","urlize_name":"Lao-PDR-Percent-of-firms-choosing-access-to-land-as-their-biggest-obstacle","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LAO/indicators/IC.FRM.OBS.OBST2?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms that chose access to land as the biggest obstacle faced by this establishment.

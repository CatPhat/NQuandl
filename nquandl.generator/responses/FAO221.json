The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:25:11.750Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:29:52.004Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:29:52.004Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Area (1000 Ha)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7674828,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_122LESOTHO2074POULTRYMEATTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Poultry Meat + (Total) - Lesotho","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Poultry-Meat-Total-Lesotho","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

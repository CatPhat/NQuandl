The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-03T10:37:10.488Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:41:12.704Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:41:12.704Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Other Util (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7789644,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5305WESTERNASIATOTAL2919FRUITSEXCLUDINGWINETOTAL","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Fruits - Excluding Wine + (Total) - Western Asia + (Total)","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Fruits-Excluding-Wine-Total-Western-Asia-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T15:45:22.045Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:45:15.853Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:45:15.853Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7809346,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_143MOROCCO2814AMMONIAANHYDROUS","name":"Resources Fertilizers: Ammonia, anhydrous - Morocco","urlize_name":"Resources-Fertilizers-Ammonia-anhydrous-Morocco","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Fertilizers_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

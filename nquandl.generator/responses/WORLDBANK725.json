Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.  \nDebt on Concessional terms to GDP (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-06T00:26:13.669Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:22.972Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:22.972Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6546236,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KSV_WP11630_4_6","name":"Kosovo: Bank agent is main mode of withdrawal from account, primary education or less (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Kosovo-Bank-agent-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-primary-education-or-less-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KSV/indicators/WP11630.4.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is from some other person who is associated with one's bank or financial institution (% with a primary education or less, age 15+, with a formal account)\nBank agent is main mode of withdrawal from account, primary education or less (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-19T00:11:00.611Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:32:05.007Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:32:05.007Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6453120,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BFA_WP11634_5","name":"Burkina Faso: Account used to receive wages, older adults (% age 25+)","urlize_name":"Burkina-Faso-Account-used-to-receive-wages-older-adults-age-25","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BFA/indicators/WP11634.5?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a formal account in the past 12 months to receive money or payments for work or from selling goods (% age 25+)\nAccount used to receive wages, older adults (% age 25+)","created_at":"2013-05-14T14:30:25.699Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:10:56.834Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:10:56.834Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2202453,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ROU_MS_MIL_MPRT_KD","name":"Romania: Arms imports (constant 1990 US$)","urlize_name":"Romania-Arms-imports-constant-1990-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ROU/indicators/MS.MIL.MPRT.KD?per_page=1000","description":"Arms transfers cover the supply of military weapons through sales, aid, gifts, and those made through manufacturing licenses.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

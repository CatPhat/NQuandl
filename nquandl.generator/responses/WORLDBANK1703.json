Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for AgriculÂ­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Typically, battle-related deaths occur in warfare involving the armed forces of the warring parties. This includes traditional battlefield fighting, guerrilla activities, and all kinds of bombardments of military units, cities, and villages, etc. The targets are usually the military itself and its installations or state institutions and state representatives, but there is often substantial collateral damage in the form of civilians being killed in crossfire, in indiscriminate bombings, etc. All deaths--military as well as civilian--incurred in such situations, are counted as battle-related deaths.\nBattle-related deaths (number of people)","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:23:28.895Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T17:13:23.030Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2582415,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"USA_MYS_POP_7579_PRI_FE","name":"United States: population in thousand, 75-79, female, primary","urlize_name":"United-States-population-in-thousand-75-79-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/USA/indicators/MYS.POP.7579.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 75-79, female, primary is the total number of females age 75-79 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 75-79, female, primary","created_at":"2013-01-16T13:52:22.984Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:41:29.370Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:41:29.370Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6445864,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEN_WP11631_4_4","name":"Benin: Bank agent is main mode of deposit into account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","urlize_name":"Benin-Bank-agent-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-young-adults-with-an-account-age-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEN/indicators/WP11631.4.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is from some other person who is associated with one's bank or financial institution (% ages 15-24, with a formal account)\nBank agent is main mode of deposit into account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","created_at":"2013-05-14T12:53:49.709Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:22:33.150Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:22:33.150Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":347289,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GMB_FS_AST_PRVT_CN","name":"Gambia, The: Banking survey: claims on private sector (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Gambia-The-Banking-survey-claims-on-private-sector-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GMB/indicators/FS.AST.PRVT.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Domestic credit to private sector refers to financial resources provided to the private sector, such as through loans, purchases of nonequity securities, and trade credits and other accounts receivable, that establish a claim for repayment.

Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process.

Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for AgriculÂ­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

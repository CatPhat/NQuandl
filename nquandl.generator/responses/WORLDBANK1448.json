When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nAgriculture production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-02T21:04:28.982Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:49:08.476Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:49:08.476Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2269517,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"YEM_DT_DOD_PROD_AR_ST_CD","name":"Yemen, Rep.: 197_T4_Publicly Guaranteed Private, Other Liabilities, Arrears (ST)","urlize_name":"Yemen-Rep-197_T4_Publicly-Guaranteed-Private-Other-Liabilities-Arrears-ST","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/YEM/indicators/DT.DOD.PROD.AR.ST.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n197_T4_Publicly Guaranteed Private, Other Liabilities, Arrears (ST)","created_at":"2012-08-09T11:21:36.835Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T10:03:51.770Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T10:03:51.770Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-09-30","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2035123,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SAU_MYS_MEA_YSCH_2024_MA","name":"Saudi Arabia: mean years of schooling, 20 - 24, male","urlize_name":"Saudi-Arabia-mean-years-of-schooling-20-24-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SAU/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.2024.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 20 - 24, male is the mean years of schooling of the male population age 20-24.\nmean years of schooling, 20 - 24, male","created_at":"2012-08-06T19:37:56.530Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:33:38.094Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:33:38.094Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2589837,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RUS_BAR_NOED_7074_ZS","name":"Russian Federation: percentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, no education","urlize_name":"Russian-Federation-percentage-of-population-15-70-74-total-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RUS/indicators/BAR.NOED.7074.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 70-74, total, no education is the percentage of the population age 70-74 with no education.\npercentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, no education","created_at":"2013-01-16T17:52:57.057Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:49:50.402Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:49:50.402Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6549185,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LBR_UIS_DR_1_G2_M","name":"Liberia: Drop-out rate.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations includes the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA).

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

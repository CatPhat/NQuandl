The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.\nGross non-food production index (1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2013-05-22T00:31:23.503Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:48:16.545Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:48:16.545Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6609644,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRY_SN_ITK_SALT_ZS","name":"Paraguay: Consumption of iodized salt (% of households)","urlize_name":"Paraguay-Consumption-of-iodized-salt-of-households","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRY/indicators/SN.ITK.SALT.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Consumption of iodized salt refers to the percentage of households that use edible salt fortified with iodine.\nConsumption of iodized salt (% of households)","created_at":"2013-05-21T18:57:12.790Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:41:11.050Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:41:11.050Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6588035,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NZL_GFDD_EI_08","name":"New Zealand: Credit to government and state-owned enterprises to GDP (%)","urlize_name":"New-Zealand-Credit-to-government-and-state-owned-enterprises-to-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NZL/indicators/GFDD.EI.08?per_page=1000","description":"Raw data are from the electronic version of the IMFâ€™s International Financial Statistics.

This is the difference between the total debt outstanding and disbursed less debt on concessional terms.  Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end.

The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.\nGross non-food production index (1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:38:26.834Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:47:37.546Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:47:37.546Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":507770,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MNG_SP_POP_AG01_FE_IN","name":"Mongolia: Age population, age 01, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Mongolia-Age-population-age-01-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MNG/indicators/SP.POP.AG01.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, age 01, female, interpolated\nAge population, age 01, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:16:08.555Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:18:17.792Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:18:17.792Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2058194,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COG_HH_DHS_OOST_X_F","name":"Congo, Rep.: DHS: Typology of out-of-school children.

The indicator is based on UNESCOâ€™s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

It is calculated based on UNESCO's methodology as the proportion leftover from those estimated as never in school, expressed as a percent of the proportion out-of-school for children younger than the age with the highest attendance rate. \nMICS: Typology of out-of-school children.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-04T11:29:00.132Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:19:35.628Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:19:35.628Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6615043,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_MYS_PROP_5054_PRI_FE","name":"Rwanda: proportion, 50-54, female, primary","urlize_name":"Rwanda-proportion-50-54-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RWA/indicators/MYS.PROP.5054.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 50-54, female, primary is the proportion of the female population age 50-54 with primary education.\nproportion, 50-54, female, primary","created_at":"2013-05-22T00:59:24.171Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T19:34:02.469Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-21T19:34:02.469Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":393778,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ITA_MYS_MEA_YSCH_1519_MA","name":"Italy: mean years of schooling, 15-19, male","urlize_name":"Italy-mean-years-of-schooling-15-19-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ITA/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.1519.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 15-19, male is the mean years of schooling of the male population age 15-19.\nmean years of schooling, 15-19, male","created_at":"2012-01-07T01:33:42.855Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:44:39.555Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:44:39.555Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6564402,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MKD_SA_CT_CDG_D1","name":"Macedonia, FYR: CGH held by poorest 10% - Cash Transfer","urlize_name":"Macedonia-FYR-CGH-held-by-poorest-10-Cash-Transfer","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MKD/indicators/sa_ct.cdg_d1?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the CGH held by poorest 10% for Cash Transfer\nCGH held by poorest 10% - Cash Transfer","created_at":"2013-05-20T03:54:48.963Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T15:35:20.019Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T15:35:20.019Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6541017,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_WP11636_4","name":"Kenya: Account used to receive remittances , young adults (% ages 15-24)","urlize_name":"Kenya-Account-used-to-receive-remittances-young-adults-ages-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/WP11636.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a formal account in the past 12 months to receive money from family members living elsewhere (% ages 15-24)\nAccount used to receive remittances , young adults (% ages 15-24)","created_at":"2013-05-18T18:31:50.118Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:45:00.590Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:45:00.590Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2228462,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEX_UIS_REPP_1_G4_M","name":"Mexico: Percentage of repeaters in primary.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region.

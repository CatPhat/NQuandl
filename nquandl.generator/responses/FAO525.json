On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-04T15:05:15.250Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:38:05.011Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:38:05.011Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Total Population - Both sexes (1000)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7798802,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_157NICARAGUA2598OILSEEDCAKESOTHER","name":"Commodity Balances Crops: Oilseed Cakes, Other - Nicaragua","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Crops-Oilseed-Cakes-Other-Nicaragua","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form.

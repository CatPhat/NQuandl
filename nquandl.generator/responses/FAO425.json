Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:04:33.092Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T21:47:14.759Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T21:47:14.759Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1997-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7658324,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_299OCCUPIEDPALESTINIANTERRITORY1058CHICKENMEAT","name":"Prices Indices: Chicken meat - Occupied Palestinian Territory","urlize_name":"Prices-Indices-Chicken-meat-Occupied-Palestinian-Territory","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Price_Indices_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T15:55:19.378Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T00:08:52.154Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T00:08:52.154Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"1991-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price (LCU/tonne) (LCU)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7670720,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_46CONGO109INFANTFOOD","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Infant Food - Congo","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Infant-Food-Congo","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T14:49:43.322Z","updated_at":"2014-01-13T05:33:49.332Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-13T05:33:49.332Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7671088,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_107COTEDIVOIRE237SOYBEANOIL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Soybean oil - Cote d'Ivoire","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Soybean-oil-Cote-d-Ivoire","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:05:55.432Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T21:47:36.843Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T21:47:36.843Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Import Quantity (Kg)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7774405,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_74GABON2532CASSAVA","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Cassava - Gabon","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Cassava-Gabon","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T15:28:09.595Z","updated_at":"2014-01-13T01:30:34.092Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-13T01:30:34.092Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7735053,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_186SERBIAANDMONTENEGRO658COFFEESUBSTCONTCOFFEE","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Coffee Subst.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T21:31:40.903Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T16:59:03.028Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-11T16:59:03.028Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7662281,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5402NORTHERNEUROPETOTAL1092OTHERBIRDEGGSINSHELLNUMBER","name":"Production Livestock Primary: Other bird eggs,in shell (Number) - Northern Europe + (Total)","urlize_name":"Production-Livestock-Primary-Other-bird-eggs-in-shell-Number-Northern-Europe-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Production_LivestockPrimary_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.

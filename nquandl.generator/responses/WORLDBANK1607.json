Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:34:38.396Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T14:54:10.083Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T14:54:10.083Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2061430,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"QAT_BAR_SEC_ICMP_6064_ZS","name":"Qatar: percentage of population (15+), 60-64, total, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Qatar-percentage-of-population-15-60-64-total-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/QAT/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.6064.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 60-64, total, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the population age 60-64 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 60-64, total, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2012-08-07T21:30:47.713Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:23.466Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:23.466Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":194467,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARG_MYS_POP_6569_PRI_MF","name":"Argentina: population in thousand, 65-69, total, primary","urlize_name":"Argentina-population-in-thousand-65-69-total-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARG/indicators/MYS.POP.6569.PRI.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 65-69, total, primary is the total number of people age 65-69 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 65-69, total, primary","created_at":"2012-01-02T13:36:52.513Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T14:41:15.401Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T14:41:15.401Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":359555,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GTM_MYS_PROP_15UP_TER_FE","name":"Guatemala: proportion, 15+, female, tertiary","urlize_name":"Guatemala-proportion-15-female-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GTM/indicators/MYS.PROP.15UP.TER.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 15+, female, tertiary is the proportion of the female population over age 15 with tertiary education.\nproportion, 15+, female, tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-06T08:06:49.226Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:37:50.448Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:37:50.448Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":278577,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CRI_DT_DIS_DLTF_CD","name":"Costa Rica: Disbursements on external debt, long-term + IMF (DIS, current US$)","urlize_name":"Costa-Rica-Disbursements-on-external-debt-long-term-IMF-DIS-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CRI/indicators/DT.DIS.DLTF.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Disbursements are drawings by the borrower on loan commitments during the year specified.

Then the official costs of the insolvency procedure are deducted (1 cent for each percentage of the initial value). Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is taken into account, including the loss of value due to depreciation of the hotel furniture. Consistent with international accounting practice, the depreciation rate for furniture is taken to be 20%. The furniture is assumed to account for a quarter of the total value of assets.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

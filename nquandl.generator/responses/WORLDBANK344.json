A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2013-05-14T05:00:05.765Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:30:34.533Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:30:34.533Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2153980,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SOM_EN_NAGR_EMPL_IN","name":"Somalia: Non-agricultural population (FAO, number)","urlize_name":"Somalia-Non-agricultural-population-FAO-number","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SOM/indicators/EN.NAGR.EMPL.IN?per_page=1000","description":"The non-agricultural population is obtained as a residual of agricultural population from the total population.  \nNon-agricultural population (FAO, number)","created_at":"2012-08-08T23:38:26.838Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:32:50.766Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:32:50.766Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2219036,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAK_SL_EMP_SELF_FE_ZS","name":"Pakistan: Self-employed, female (% of females employed)","urlize_name":"Pakistan-Self-employed-female-of-females-employed","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAK/indicators/SL.EMP.SELF.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Self employed workers are those workers who, working on their own account or with one or a few partners or in cooperative, hold the type of jobs defined as a \"self-employment jobs\" (i.e. jobs where the remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits derived from the goods and services produced).

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations includes the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA).

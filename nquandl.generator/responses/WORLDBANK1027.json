Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

expenditures data from SIPRI are derived from the NATO definition, which includes all current and capital expenditures on the armed forces, including peacekeeping forces; defense ministries and other government agencies engaged in defense projects; paramilitary forces, if these are judged to be trained and equipped for military operations; and military space activities. Such expenditures include military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions of military personnel and social services for personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country). Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (current LCU)","created_at":"2013-05-21T13:55:08.708Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:28:46.718Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:28:46.718Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1988-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6463173,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BIH_ALLSA_COV_Q3","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina: (%) Program participation by 3rd 20%  -  All Social Safety Nets","urlize_name":"Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Program-participation-by-3rd-20-All-Social-Safety-Nets","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BIH/indicators/allsa.cov_q3?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the (%) Program participation by 3rd 20% population for All Social Safety Nets\n(%) Program participation by 3rd 20%  -  All Social Safety Nets","created_at":"2013-05-14T19:35:31.298Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T10:01:43.032Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T10:01:43.032Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6430274,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARG_GFDD_DM_05","name":"Argentina: Outstanding international private debt decurities to GDP (%)","urlize_name":"Argentina-Outstanding-international-private-debt-decurities-to-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARG/indicators/GFDD.DM.05?per_page=1000","description":"Amount of private international debt securities (amounts outstanding), as a share of GDP.

Primary. Never in school. Male is the percentage of male out-of-school primary-school-age children who have never attended school and are not likely to enter school in the future. Since no survey can say definitively that a school-age person will never attend school, this is a probabilistic indicator. The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

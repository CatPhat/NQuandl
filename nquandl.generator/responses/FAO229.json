Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:48:22.953Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T22:53:21.933Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T22:53:21.933Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7832571,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_39CHAD23006LANDDEVELOPMENT","name":"Investment Capital Stock: Land Development - Chad","urlize_name":"Investment-Capital-Stock-Land-Development-Chad","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Investment_CapitalStock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Investment Domain in FAOSTAT includes: Capital stock, External assistance to agriculture, Machinery.

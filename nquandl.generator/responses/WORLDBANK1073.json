Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process. The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.\nCO2 emissions from cement production (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-07T08:37:30.266Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:20:16.991Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:20:16.991Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":234277,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BOL_GER_PRE_POP_ATTN_4044_MA","name":"Bolivia: Population by educational attainment, no-school, male (aged 40-44)","urlize_name":"Bolivia-Population-by-educational-attainment-no-school-male-aged-40-44","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BOL/indicators/GER.PRE.POP.ATTN.4044.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population by educational attainment, no-school, male (aged 40-44) is the total number of males age 40-44 with no education.\nPopulation by educational attainment, no-school, male (aged 40-44)","created_at":"2012-01-03T07:42:31.329Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:44:11.169Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":300226,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DOM_MYS_PROP_5559_NED_MA","name":"Dominican Republic: proportion, 55-59, male, no education","urlize_name":"Dominican-Republic-proportion-55-59-male-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DOM/indicators/MYS.PROP.5559.NED.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 55-59, male, no education is the proportion of the male population age 55-59 with no education.\nproportion, 55-59, male, no education","created_at":"2012-01-05T00:38:55.276Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:51:54.121Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:51:54.121Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":474554,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDV_MYS_PROP_15UP_SEC_MA","name":"Maldives: proportion, 15+, male, secondary","urlize_name":"Maldives-proportion-15-male-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MDV/indicators/MYS.PROP.15UP.SEC.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 15+, male, secondary is the proportion of the male population over age 15 with secondary education.\nproportion, 15+, male, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-10T12:48:40.058Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:01.214Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:01.214Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2111479,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_UIS_E_3_V_PU_F","name":"Croatia: Enrolment in upper secondary.

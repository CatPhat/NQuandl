Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:48:26.508Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:45:51.158Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:45:51.158Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2215576,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CHE_NEGDIKSTKKD","name":"Switzerland: Estimated Capital stock (real 2005 USD)","urlize_name":"Switzerland-Estimated-Capital-stock-real-2005-USD","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CHE/indicators/NEGDIKSTKKD?per_page=1000","description":"\nEstimated Capital stock (real 2005 USD)","created_at":"2012-08-09T06:01:32.488Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T23:45:56.800Z","refreshed_at":"2013-08-30T23:45:56.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2279822,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"YEM_FB_CBK_BRWR_P3","name":"Yemen, Rep.: Borrowers from commercial banks (per 1,000 adults)","urlize_name":"Yemen-Rep-Borrowers-from-commercial-banks-per-1-000-adults","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/YEM/indicators/FB.CBK.BRWR.P3?per_page=1000","description":"Borrowers from commercial banks are the reported number of resident customers that are nonfinancial corporations (public and private) and households who obtained loans from commercial banks and other banks functioning as commercial banks.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-01-07T06:37:42.087Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:03.846Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:03.846Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6501300,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COM_WP11631_4_5","name":"Comoros: Bank agent is main mode of deposit into account, older adults (% with an account,  age 25+)","urlize_name":"Comoros-Bank-agent-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-older-adults-with-an-account-age-25","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COM/indicators/WP11631.4.5?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is from some other person who is associated with one's bank or financial institution (% age 25+, with a formal account)\nBank agent is main mode of deposit into account, older adults (% with an account,  age 25+)","created_at":"2013-05-15T23:04:17.617Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:00:02.756Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:00:02.756Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2230063,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARM_IC_FRM_FCHAR_CAR6","name":"Armenia: Proportion of a firm held by the largest owner(s) (%)","urlize_name":"Armenia-Proportion-of-a-firm-held-by-the-largest-owner-s","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARM/indicators/IC.FRM.FCHAR.CAR6?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of a firm held by the largest owner(s).

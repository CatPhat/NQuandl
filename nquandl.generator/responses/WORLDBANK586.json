Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:02:31.377Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:30:28.646Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:30:28.646Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6487430,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUR_WP11655_6","name":"Turkey: Loan from an informal private lender in the past year, primary education or less (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Turkey-Loan-from-an-informal-private-lender-in-the-past-year-primary-education-or-less-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUR/indicators/WP11655.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a private lender (including informal money lenders) (% with a primary education or less, age 15+)\nLoan from an informal private lender in the past year, primary education or less (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-15T09:13:00.867Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:27:06.354Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:27:06.354Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":469762,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDG_GC_TAX_OTHR_RV_ZS","name":"Madagascar: Other taxes (% of revenue)","urlize_name":"Madagascar-Other-taxes-of-revenue","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MDG/indicators/GC.TAX.OTHR.RV.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Other taxes include employer payroll or labor taxes, taxes on property, and taxes not allocable to other categories, such as penalties for late payment or nonpayment of taxes.\nOther taxes (% of revenue)","created_at":"2012-01-10T09:33:27.006Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:29:48.562Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:29:48.562Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":506329,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MLT_BAR_SEC_ICMP_6569_ZS","name":"Malta: percentage of population (15+), 65-69, total, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Malta-percentage-of-population-15-65-69-total-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MLT/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.6569.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 65-69, total, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the population age 65-69 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 65-69, total, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:03:16.412Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:28:12.816Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:28:12.816Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":392218,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ITA_EG_ELC_HYRO_ZS","name":"Italy: Electricity production from hydroelectric sources (% of total)","urlize_name":"Italy-Electricity-production-from-hydroelectric-sources-of-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ITA/indicators/EG.ELC.HYRO.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Sources of electricity refer to the inputs used to generate electricity.

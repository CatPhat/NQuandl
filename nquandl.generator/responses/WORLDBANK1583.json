The FDI included here is total net, that is, net FDI in the reporting economy from foreign sources less net FDI by the reporting economy to the rest of the world. Portfolio investment excludes liabilities constituting foreign authorities' reserves and covers transactions in equity securities and debt securities.\nPrivate capital flows, total (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:03:46.736Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T18:45:15.096Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":338890,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_LO_TIMSS_SCI4","name":"Georgia: TIMSS:Mean performance on the science scale  for fourth grade students, total","urlize_name":"Georgia-TIMSS-Mean-performance-on-the-science-scale-for-fourth-grade-students-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/LO.TIMSS.SCI4?per_page=1000","description":"TIMSS: Mean performance on the science scale for fourth grade students, total\nTIMSS:Mean performance on the science scale  for fourth grade students, total","created_at":"2012-01-05T21:08:14.659Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T19:44:57.967Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-21T19:44:57.967Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2075971,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"YEM_TM_TAX_MANF_SM_AR_ZS","name":"Yemen, Rep.: Tariff rate, applied, simple mean, manufactured products (%)","urlize_name":"Yemen-Rep-Tariff-rate-applied-simple-mean-manufactured-products","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/YEM/indicators/TM.TAX.MANF.SM.AR.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Simple mean applied tariff is the unweighted average of effectively applied rates for all products subject to tariffs calculated for all traded goods.

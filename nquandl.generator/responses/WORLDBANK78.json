Secondary is the ratio of the female percentage of trained teachers for secondary to the male percentage of trained teachers for secondary. It is calculated by dividing the female value for the indicator by the male value for the indicator. A GPI equal to 1 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value less than 1 indicates disparity in favor of men and a value greater than 1 indicates disparity in favor of women.\nGender parity index for % of trained teachers.

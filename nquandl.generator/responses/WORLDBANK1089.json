A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:02:15.912Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:03:02.036Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:03:02.036Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2129088,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TZA_GER_PRI_POP_ATTN_4549_MA","name":"Tanzania: Population by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 45-49)","urlize_name":"Tanzania-Population-by-educational-attainment-primary-male-aged-45-49","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TZA/indicators/GER.PRI.POP.ATTN.4549.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 45-49) is the total number of males age 45-49 with primary education.\nPopulation by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 45-49)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:27:07.086Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T18:30:53.671Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6591517,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAN_GFDD_EI_08","name":"Panama: Credit to government and state-owned enterprises to GDP (%)","urlize_name":"Panama-Credit-to-government-and-state-owned-enterprises-to-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAN/indicators/GFDD.EI.08?per_page=1000","description":"Raw data are from the electronic version of the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.

Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs.

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-04T04:34:07.369Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:40:56.386Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:40:56.386Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6568494,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MOZ_GFDD_OI_01","name":"Mozambique: Bank concentration (%)","urlize_name":"Mozambique-Bank-concentration","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MOZ/indicators/GFDD.OI.01?per_page=1000","description":"Raw data are from Bankscope.

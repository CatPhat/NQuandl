It is assumed that neither the exporter nor the importer wastes time and that each commits to completing each remaining procedure without delay.

This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of female literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100. \nLiteracy rate, adult female (% of females ages 15 and above)","created_at":"2012-01-05T02:35:58.213Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T20:02:19.380Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T20:02:19.380Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2063999,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRI_NY_GSR_NFCY_KN","name":"Puerto Rico: Net income from abroad (constant LCU)","urlize_name":"Puerto-Rico-Net-income-from-abroad-constant-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRI/indicators/NY.GSR.NFCY.KN?per_page=1000","description":"Net income includes the net labor income and net property and entrepreneurial income components of the SNA.

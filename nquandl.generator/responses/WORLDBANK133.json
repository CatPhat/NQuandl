Tertiary is the number of female teachers at the tertiary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the tertiary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nTertiary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-09T08:39:07.887Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:17:37.399Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:17:37.399Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":388653,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ISR_BAR_POP_1519_FE","name":"Israel: population in thousands (age 15+), 15-19, female","urlize_name":"Israel-population-in-thousands-age-15-15-19-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ISR/indicators/BAR.POP.1519.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousands, 15-19, female is the female population of 15-19 year olds in thousands estimated by Barro-Lee.\npopulation in thousands (age 15+), 15-19, female","created_at":"2012-01-06T22:45:44.173Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:35:03.706Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:35:03.706Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2158411,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MWI_DT_DOD_ALLN_ZSX","name":"Malawi: Debt on Non-concessional terms to export ratio (% of exports)","urlize_name":"Malawi-Debt-on-Non-concessional-terms-to-export-ratio-of-exports","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MWI/indicators/DT.DOD.ALLN.ZSX?per_page=1000","description":"Non-concessional LDOD conveys information about the borrower's receipt of aid from official lenders on non-concessional terms as defined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

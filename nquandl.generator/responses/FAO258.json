The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T11:17:43.203Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T19:16:08.382Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-11T19:16:08.382Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7850189,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_56DOMINICANREPUBLIC1663BLEACHEDSULPHATEPULP","name":"Forestry: Bleached Sulphate Pulp - Dominican Republic","urlize_name":"Forestry-Bleached-Sulphate-Pulp-Dominican-Republic","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:04:00.750Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:34:12.574Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:34:12.574Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7833744,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_150NETHERLANDS23009MACHINERYEQUIPMENT","name":"Investment Capital Stock: Machinery & Equipment - Netherlands","urlize_name":"Investment-Capital-Stock-Machinery-Equipment-Netherlands","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Investment_CapitalStock_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Investment Domain in FAOSTAT includes: Capital stock, External assistance to agriculture, Machinery.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:03:54.740Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T15:18:01.542Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T15:18:01.542Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7740745,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_153NEWCALEDONIA661COCOABEANS","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cocoa beans - New Caledonia","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cocoa-beans-New-Caledonia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T20:20:31.309Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T15:18:14.011Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T15:18:14.011Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7677358,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_143MOROCCO1962OILSEEDCAKENESTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Oilseed Cake nes + (Total) - Morocco","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Oilseed-Cake-nes-Total-Morocco","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T19:05:35.373Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:30.342Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:30.342Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7665416,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_87GUADELOUPE2054FOODPINTOTAL","name":"Value of Production: Food (PIN) + (Total) - Guadeloupe","urlize_name":"Value-of-Production-Food-PIN-Total-Guadeloupe","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Value_of_Production_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

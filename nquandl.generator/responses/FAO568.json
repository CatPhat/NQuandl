The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:27:33.767Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:09:53.760Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:09:53.760Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Area (1000 Ha)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7647660,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5303SOUTHERNASIATOTAL116POTATOES","name":"Emissions Agriculture Crop Residues: Potatoes - Southern Asia + (Total)","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Crop-Residues-Potatoes-Southern-Asia-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Crop_Residues_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:03:33.747Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T12:57:43.854Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T12:57:43.854Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7846635,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_238ETHIOPIA1651INDRWDWIRC","name":"Forestry: Ind Rwd Wir (C) - Ethiopia","urlize_name":"Forestry-Ind-Rwd-Wir-C-Ethiopia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961.

In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources. Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:47:40.293Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:22.431Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:22.431Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7798593,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_86GRENADA2577PALMOIL","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Palm Oil - Grenada","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Palm-Oil-Grenada","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:49:00.046Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:02.590Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:02.590Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7777482,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_19BOLIVIAPLURINATIONALSTATEOF2641PIMENTO","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Pimento - Bolivia (Plurinational State of)","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Pimento-Bolivia-Plurinational-State-of","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

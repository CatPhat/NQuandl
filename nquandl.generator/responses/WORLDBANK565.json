Secondary is the number of female teachers at the secondary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the secondary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nSecondary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-05T20:32:42.165Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:37:38.517Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:37:38.517Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6577722,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NAM_SL_EMP_TOTL","name":"Namibia: Total employment, total (ages 15+)","urlize_name":"Namibia-Total-employment-total-ages-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NAM/indicators/SL.EMP.TOTL?per_page=1000","description":"Total employment shows the total number employed ages 15 and over.\nTotal employment, total (ages 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-20T20:08:01.337Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:44:22.501Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:44:22.501Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2054848,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LVA_SI_SS_BI_Q5","name":"Latvia: (%) Benefits held by 5th 20% population -

Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-01-05T18:59:15.805Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:56:11.505Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:56:11.505Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":276333,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COM_NEEXPGNFSCN","name":"Comoros: Exports GNFS, current LCU, millions","urlize_name":"Comoros-Exports-GNFS-current-LCU-millions","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COM/indicators/NEEXPGNFSCN?per_page=1000","description":"Exports of goods and services represent the value of all goods and other market services provided to the rest of the world.

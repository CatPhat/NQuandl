The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:04:08.368Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T08:00:59.572Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T08:00:59.572Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Non-fertilizer use (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7693855,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_170PERU72FLOUROFRYE","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Flour of Rye - Peru","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Flour-of-Rye-Peru","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-04T22:33:22.871Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T16:50:56.675Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-11T16:50:56.675Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7654243,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_178ERITREA1012INDIGENOUSSHEEPMEAT","name":"Value of Production: Indigenous Sheep Meat - Eritrea","urlize_name":"Value-of-Production-Indigenous-Sheep-Meat-Eritrea","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Value_of_Production_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T22:44:37.656Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:41:12.466Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:41:12.466Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Non-fertilizer use (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7740948,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_156NEWZEALAND19GERMOFWHEAT","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Germ of Wheat - New Zealand","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Germ-of-Wheat-New-Zealand","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

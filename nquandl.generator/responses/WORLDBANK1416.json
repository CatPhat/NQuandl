Takes a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that only a single product is exported.  Higher values indicate that exports are concentrated in fewer sectors.  On the contrary, values closer to 0 reflect a more equal distribution of market shares among exporters.

Doing Business 2008 reports the total tax rate for fiscal 2006. The total amount of taxes is the sum of all the different taxes and contributions payable after accounting for deductions and exemptions. The taxes withheld (such as sales or value added tax or personal income tax) but not paid by the company are excluded. The taxes included can be divided into 5 categories: profit or corporate income tax, social contribu­tions and labor taxes paid by the employer (for which all mandatory contributions are included, even if paid to a private entity such as a requited pension fund), property taxes, turnover taxes and other small taxes (such as municipal fees and vehicle and fuel taxes).

When data on number of tourists are not available, the number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members, is shown instead. Sources and collection methods for arrivals differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police, immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in hotels. Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries. The data on inbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals, not to the number of people traveling. Thus a person who makes several trips to a country during a given period is counted each time as a new arrival.\nInternational tourism, number of arrivals","created_at":"2012-01-03T05:59:57.813Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:35:37.777Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:35:37.777Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2236902,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DNK_NECONPRVTXD","name":"Denmark: Private Consumption (implicit price deflator contant 2005 USD)","urlize_name":"Denmark-Private-Consumption-implicit-price-deflator-contant-2005-USD","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DNK/indicators/NECONPRVTXD?per_page=1000","description":"\nPrivate Consumption (implicit price deflator contant 2005 USD)","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:03:37.491Z","updated_at":"2013-08-29T15:48:59.514Z","refreshed_at":"2013-08-29T15:48:59.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2257896,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SAU_WP11632_10","name":"Saudi Arabia: Checks used to make payments , rural (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Saudi-Arabia-Checks-used-to-make-payments-rural-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SAU/indicators/WP11632.10?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used checks in the past 12 months to make payments on bills or to buy things using money from their accounts (% living in an urban area, age 15+ )\nChecks used to make payments , rural (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T10:15:11.142Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:19.824Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:19.824Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6437215,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AZE_GFDD_SI_01","name":"Azerbaijan: Bank Z-score","urlize_name":"Azerbaijan-Bank-Z-score","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AZE/indicators/GFDD.SI.01?per_page=1000","description":"It captures the probability of default of a country's banking system, calculated as a weighted average of the z-scores of a country's individual banks (the weights are based on the individual banks' total assets).

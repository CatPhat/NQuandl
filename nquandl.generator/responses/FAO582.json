The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-03T14:38:31.806Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T08:15:07.879Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-26T08:15:07.879Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Feed (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7648153,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5305WESTERNASIATOTAL1800VEGETABLESMELONSTOTALTOTAL","name":"Production Crops: Vegetables&Melons, Total + (Total) - Western Asia + (Total)","urlize_name":"Production-Crops-Vegetables-Melons-Total-Total-Western-Asia-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Production_Crops_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T19:17:57.029Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T15:46:30.525Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T15:46:30.525Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7688620,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_55DOMINICA875PREPARATIONSOFBEEFMEAT","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Preparations of Beef Meat - Dominica","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Preparations-of-Beef-Meat-Dominica","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:03:13.962Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T22:11:49.527Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T22:11:49.527Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)","Import Quantity (Kg)","Export Quantity (Kg)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7671568,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_250DEMOCRATICREPUBLICOFTHECONGO1009WOOLHAIRWASTE","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Wool;Hair Waste - Democratic Republic of the Congo","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Wool-Hair-Waste-Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:58:39.713Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T15:46:00.887Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T15:46:00.887Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (m3)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (m3)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7836756,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_104IRELAND2455013OTHERAGRICULTURALTRACTORS","name":"Investment Machinery: Other Agricultural tractors - Ireland","urlize_name":"Investment-Machinery-Other-Agricultural-tractors-Ireland","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Investment_Machinery_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Investment Domain in FAOSTAT includes: Capital stock, External assistance to agriculture, Machinery.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.

Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Details of the survey methodology are in Arvis and others' Connecting to Compete 2010: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy (2010). Respondents assessed how often the shipments to assessed markets reach the consignee within the scheduled or expected delivery time, on a rating ranging from 1 (hardly ever) to 5 (nearly always). Scores are averaged across all respondents.\nLogistics performance index: Frequency with which shipments reach consignee within scheduled or expected time (1=low to 5=high)","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:44:48.145Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:44:43.002Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:44:43.002Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":259508,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_SP_RUR_TOTL_ZG","name":"Cameroon: Rural population growth (annual %)","urlize_name":"Cameroon-Rural-population-growth-annual","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZG?per_page=1000","description":"Rural population refers to people living in rural areas as defined by national statistical offices.

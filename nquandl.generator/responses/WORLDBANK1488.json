Such expenditures include military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions of military personnel and social services for personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country). Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (% of central government expenditure)","created_at":"2012-01-02T09:06:06.549Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:10:57.338Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:10:57.338Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2004-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6587935,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NZL_GC_FIN_DOMS_CN","name":"New Zealand: Net incurrence of liabilities, domestic (current LCU)","urlize_name":"New-Zealand-Net-incurrence-of-liabilities-domestic-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NZL/indicators/GC.FIN.DOMS.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Net incurrence of government liabilities includes foreign financing (obtained from nonresidents) and domestic financing (obtained from residents), or the means by which a government provides financial resources to cover a budget deficit or allocates financial resources arising from a budget surplus.

It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States.\nPPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate ratio","created_at":"2013-05-14T22:45:09.771Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:34:25.334Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:34:25.334Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":317524,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ETH_SP_POP_1419_FE_UN","name":"Ethiopia: Population, aged 14-19, female","urlize_name":"Ethiopia-Population-aged-14-19-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ETH/indicators/SP.POP.1419.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 14-19, female is the total number of females age 14-19.\nPopulation, aged 14-19, female","created_at":"2012-01-05T10:24:47.081Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:34:25.392Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:34:25.392Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":471636,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDV_BX_TRF_CURR_CD","name":"Maldives: Secondary income receipts (BoP, current US$)","urlize_name":"Maldives-Secondary-income-receipts-BoP-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MDV/indicators/BX.TRF.CURR.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Secondary income refers to transfers recorded in the balance of payments whenever an economy provides or receives goods, services, income, or financial items without a quid pro quo.

Publicly guaranteed debt is an external obligation of a private debtor that is guaranteed for repayment by a public entity. Net transfers are net flows minus interest payments during the year; negative transfers show net transfers made by the borrower to the creditor during the year. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents by residents of an economy and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

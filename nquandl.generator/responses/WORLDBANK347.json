Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

Percentage of population covered by mobile cellular telephony refers to the percentage of a country’s inhabitants that live within areas served by a mobile cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they choose to use it. This should not be confused with the percentage of the land area covered by a mobile cellular signal or the percentage of the population that subscribe to mobile cellular service. Note that this measures the theoretical ability to use mobile cellular services if one has a cellular telephone and a subscription.  \nPopulation coverage of mobile cellular telephony (%)","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:47:42.210Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:33:58.868Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:33:58.868Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6431775,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SRB_BAR_SEC_ICMP_3034_FE_ZS","name":"Serbia: percentage of population (15+), 30-34, female, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Serbia-percentage-of-population-15-30-34-female-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SRB/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.3034.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 30-34, female, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the female population age 30-34 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 30-34, female, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2013-05-14T04:47:54.886Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:30:12.044Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:30:12.044Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6442179,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVN_BAR_SEC_CMPT_5054_ZS","name":"Slovenia: percentage of population (15+), 50-54, total, completed secondary","urlize_name":"Slovenia-percentage-of-population-15-50-54-total-completed-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVN/indicators/BAR.SEC.CMPT.5054.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 50-54, total, completed secondary is the percentage of people age 50-54 who have completed secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 50-54, total, completed secondary","created_at":"2013-05-14T12:04:51.939Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:04:42.918Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:04:42.918Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6447142,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVN_UIS_R_23_GPV_G4_F","name":"Slovenia: Repeaters in secondary.

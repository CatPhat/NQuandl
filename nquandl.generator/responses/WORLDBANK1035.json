Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-07T00:59:46.660Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:14:08.386Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:14:08.386Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2184062,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ROU_IC_FRM_TRNG_ZS","name":"Romania: Firms offering formal training (% of firms)","urlize_name":"Romania-Firms-offering-formal-training-of-firms","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ROU/indicators/IC.FRM.TRNG.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Firms offering formal training are the percentage of firms offering formal training programs for their permanent, full-time employees.\nFirms offering formal training (% of firms)","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:02:26.627Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:22:05.177Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:22:05.177Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2002-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2170747,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MWI_ALLSA_AVT_Q4","name":"Malawi: Beneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 4th 20% population -

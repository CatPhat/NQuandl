Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Principal repayments are actual amounts of principal (amortization) paid in foreign currency, goods, or services in the year specified.  \nDebt outstanding and disbursed, PPG Bilateral on nonconcessional terms (DOD, current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-07T07:54:13.396Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:52:11.200Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:52:11.200Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2006-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":252221,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CHE_MYS_POP_3539_NED_FE","name":"Switzerland: population in thousand, 35-39, female, no education","urlize_name":"Switzerland-population-in-thousand-35-39-female-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CHE/indicators/MYS.POP.3539.NED.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 35-39, female, no education is the total number of females age 35-39 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 35-39, female, no education","created_at":"2012-01-04T03:03:14.327Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:23:14.861Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:23:14.861Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2139012,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UKR_ALLSA_AVT_Q4","name":"Ukraine: Beneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 4th 20% population - All Social Safety Nets","urlize_name":"Ukraine-Beneficiaries-per-capita-transfer-held-by-4th-20-population-All-Social-Safety-Nets","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UKR/indicators/allsa.avt_q4?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Beneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 4th 20% population for All Social Safety Nets \nBeneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 4th 20% population - All Social Safety Nets ","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:15:45.185Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T13:40:12.409Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T13:40:12.409Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2006-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6472905,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"THA_UIS_DR_1_G2_F","name":"Thailand: Drop-out rate.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

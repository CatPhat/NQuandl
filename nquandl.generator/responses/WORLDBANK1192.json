Secondary is the enrolment in private secondary schools expressed as a percentage of total enrolment (public and private) in secondary schools. 'Private' refers to all educational institutions not operated by a public authority, regardless of whether they receive financial support from public authorities. A high percentage indicates strong involvement of the non-governmental sector (including religious bodies, other organizations, associations, communities, private enterprises or persons) in providing organized educational programmes.\nSchool enrollment, secondary, private (% of total secondary)","created_at":"2012-01-05T23:15:41.631Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:33:29.094Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:33:29.094Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":316313,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ESP_MYS_POP_1564_PRI_MF","name":"Spain: population in thousand, 15-64, total, primary","urlize_name":"Spain-population-in-thousand-15-64-total-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ESP/indicators/MYS.POP.1564.PRI.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-64, total, primary is the total number of people age 15-64 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-64, total, primary","created_at":"2012-01-05T09:54:20.139Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:52:46.885Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:52:46.885Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":335350,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GAB_PV_PER_RNK","name":"Gabon: Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Percentile Rank","urlize_name":"Gabon-Political-Stability-and-Absence-of-Violence-Terrorism-Percentile-Rank","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GAB/indicators/PV.PER.RNK?per_page=1000","description":"Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism captures perceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically-motivated violence and terrorism.\nPolitical Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Percentile Rank","created_at":"2012-01-05T19:38:48.787Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:24:44.743Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:24:44.743Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2130168,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NOR_UIS_XPUBP_2","name":"Norway: Educational expenditure in lower secondary as % of total educational expenditure","urlize_name":"Norway-Educational-expenditure-in-lower-secondary-as-of-total-educational-expenditure","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NOR/indicators/UIS.XPUBP.2?per_page=1000","description":"Educational expenditure in lower secondary as % of total educational expenditure is the percentage of public education expenditure for lower secondary education.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for AgriculÂ­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports.

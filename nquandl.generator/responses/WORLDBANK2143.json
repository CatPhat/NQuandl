Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the import volume indexes (lines 73) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nImport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-10T17:54:10.710Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:43:21.198Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:43:21.198Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6471014,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TGO_SP_POP_1015_FE_UN","name":"Togo: Population, aged 10-15, female","urlize_name":"Togo-Population-aged-10-15-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TGO/indicators/SP.POP.1015.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 10-15, female is the total number of females age 10-15.\nPopulation, aged 10-15, female","created_at":"2013-05-14T22:57:39.151Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:43:21.302Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:43:21.302Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":359789,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GUY_DT_TDS_DECT_EX_ZS","name":"Guyana: Total debt service (% of exports of goods, services and primary income)","urlize_name":"Guyana-Total-debt-service-of-exports-of-goods-services-and-primary-income","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GUY/indicators/DT.TDS.DECT.EX.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Total debt service is the sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in foreign currency, goods, or services on long-term debt, interest paid on short-term debt, and repayments (repurchases and charges) to the IMF.\nTotal debt service (% of exports of goods, services and primary income)","created_at":"2012-01-06T08:16:04.372Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:43:21.366Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:43:21.366Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1977-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2246503,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"STP_EG_USE_COMM_GD_PP_KD","name":"Sao Tome and Principe: Energy use (kg of oil equivalent) per $1,000 GDP (constant 2005 PPP)","urlize_name":"Sao-Tome-and-Principe-Energy-use-kg-of-oil-equivalent-per-1-000-GDP-constant-2005-PPP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/STP/indicators/EG.USE.COMM.GD.PP.KD?per_page=1000","description":"Energy use per PPP GDP is the kilogram of oil equivalent of energy use per constant PPP GDP.

Numerator: Number of HIV-infected pregnant women who received antiretrovirals during the last 12 months to reduce mother-to-child transmission.  Denominator: Estimated number of HIV-infected pregnant women in the last 12 months.  The purpose of this indicator is to assess progress in preventing vertical transmission of HIV.  All data reflect values representing 12 month period ending December 2007 which have been reconciled between reporting country and UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF, unless otherwise noted.  All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year. Every effort was made in cases of discrepancy across the three agencies to obtain approval from the country on a final indicator value.  \nHIV positive pregnant women receiving antiretrovirals, using WHO/UNAIDS methodology (%)","created_at":"2012-08-07T20:09:28.486Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:01:18.635Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:01:18.635Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2215627,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"FIN_UIS_REPR_1_G3","name":"Finland: Repetition rate in primary.

That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Commitments Index, all service sectors (0 least liberal to 100 most liberal)","created_at":"2012-03-05T11:24:02.935Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:38:37.299Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:38:37.299Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":278089,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CUB_SP_POP_AG10_FE_UN","name":"Cuba: Population, aged 10, female","urlize_name":"Cuba-Population-aged-10-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CUB/indicators/SP.POP.AG10.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 10, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 10, female","created_at":"2012-01-04T13:10:43.702Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:44:35.719Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:44:35.719Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":367132,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HND_MYS_MEA_YSCH_15UP_MA","name":"Honduras: mean years of schooling, 15+, male","urlize_name":"Honduras-mean-years-of-schooling-15-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HND/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.15UP.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 15+, male is the mean years of schooling of the male population over age 15.\nmean years of schooling, 15+, male","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:05:47.111Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:23:27.552Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:23:27.552Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2097712,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUR_SA_CT_AVT_Q5","name":"Turkey: Beneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 5th 20% population - Cash Transfer","urlize_name":"Turkey-Beneficiaries-per-capita-transfer-held-by-5th-20-population-Cash-Transfer","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUR/indicators/sa_ct.avt_q5?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Beneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 5th 20% population for Cash Transfer \nBeneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 5th 20% population - Cash Transfer ","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:43:19.087Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T09:32:02.413Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T09:32:02.413Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2026080,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CHN_UIS_ROFST_2_M","name":"China: Out-of-school rate for children of lower secondary school age (%).

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

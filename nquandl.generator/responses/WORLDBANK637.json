The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region.

This indicator is also known as \"Gender parity index for expected gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary.\"\nGender parity index for expected primary completion rate","created_at":"2013-05-14T11:05:55.605Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:14:49.550Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:14:49.550Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2195319,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRT_MYS_POP_1544_NED_MA","name":"Portugal: population in thousand, 15-44, male, no education","urlize_name":"Portugal-population-in-thousand-15-44-male-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRT/indicators/MYS.POP.1544.NED.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-44, male, no education is the total number of males age 15-44 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-44, male, no education","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:08:39.022Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:49:50.715Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:49:50.715Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":264763,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COG_SP_POP_AG06_FE_IN","name":"Congo, Rep.: Age population, age 06, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Congo-Rep-Age-population-age-06-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COG/indicators/SP.POP.AG06.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 06, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-01-04T07:54:29.261Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:23:17.741Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:23:17.741Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":321905,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"FIN_BAR_POP_75UP_FE","name":"Finland: population in thousands (age 15+), 75+, female","urlize_name":"Finland-population-in-thousands-age-15-75-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/FIN/indicators/BAR.POP.75UP.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousands,75+, female is the female population over age 75 in thousands estimated by Barro-Lee.\npopulation in thousands (age 15+), 75+, female","created_at":"2012-01-05T12:23:28.498Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:49:50.818Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:49:50.818Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2055775,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ETH_UIS_R_23_GPV_G6","name":"Ethiopia: Repeaters in secondary.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

It measures the elasticity of banks revenues relative to input prices. Under perfect competition, an increase in input prices raises both marginal costs and total revenues by the same amount, and hence the H-statistic equals 1. Under a monopoly, an increase in input prices results in a rise in marginal costs, a fall in output, and a decline in revenues, leading to an H-statistic less than or equal to 0. When H is between 0 and 1, the system operates under monopolistic competition. (For more information, see Panzar and Rosse 1982, 1987).

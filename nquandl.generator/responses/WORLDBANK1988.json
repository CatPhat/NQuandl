Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the export volume indexes (lines 72) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nExport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2013-05-14T19:28:33.375Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:54:50.731Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:54:50.731Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2065671,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEL_DP_DOD_DLTC_CR_CG_CD","name":"Belgium: 040.Long-term, by original maturity (PSDCG, LT) US$","urlize_name":"Belgium-040-Long-term-by-original-maturity-PSDCG-LT-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEL/indicators/DP.DOD.DLTC.CR.CG.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n040.Long-term, by original maturity (PSDCG, LT) US$","created_at":"2012-08-08T12:57:01.916Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:54:51.136Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:54:51.136Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-03-31","to_date":"2014-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":343532,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GMB_ST_INT_RCPT_XP_ZS","name":"Gambia, The: International tourism, receipts (% of total exports)","urlize_name":"Gambia-The-International-tourism-receipts-of-total-exports","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GMB/indicators/ST.INT.RCPT.XP.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"International tourism receipts are expenditures by international inbound visitors, including payments to national carriers for international transport.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-10T04:49:13.942Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:51:08.826Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:51:08.826Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":265566,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COG_AG_PRD_MZE_MT","name":"Congo, Rep.: Maize production (metric tons)","urlize_name":"Congo-Rep-Maize-production-metric-tons","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COG/indicators/AG.PRD.MZE.MT?per_page=1000","description":"Production data on maize relate to crop harvested for dry grain only.

Primary. Never in school. Urban is the percentage of urban out-of-school primary-school-age children who have never attended school and are not likely to enter school in the future. Since no survey can say definitively that a school-age person will never attend school, this is a probabilistic indicator. The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Commitments Index, all service sectors (0 least liberal to 100 most liberal)","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:43:39.474Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:03:48.020Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:03:48.020Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2069376,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VEN_WP11659_1","name":"Venezuela, RB: Personally paid for agriculture insurance (% who work in farming/fishing/forestry, age 15+)","urlize_name":"Venezuela-RB-Personally-paid-for-agriculture-insurance-who-work-in-farming-fishing-forestry-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/VEN/indicators/WP11659.1?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who are farming, fishing or forestry workers and in the past 12 months have personally paid for crop, rainfall, or livestock insurance (% age 15+)\nPersonally paid for agriculture insurance (% who work in farming/fishing/forestry, age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T13:25:24.199Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:22:59.569Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:22:59.569Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6522935,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GMB_UIS_DR_1_G4","name":"Gambia, The: Drop-out rate.

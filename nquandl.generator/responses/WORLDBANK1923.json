Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. Net transfers are net flows minus interest payments during the year; negative transfers show net transfers made by the borrower to the creditor during the year.

Household final consumption expenditure (private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes payments and fees to governments to obtain permits and licenses. Here, household consumption expenditure includes the expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country.\nHousehold final consumption expenditure per capita growth (annual %)","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:46:17.411Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:27:26.515Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:27:26.515Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1962-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":365657,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HND_DT_NFL_MIDA_CD","name":"Honduras: Net financial flows, IDA (NFL, current US$)","urlize_name":"Honduras-Net-financial-flows-IDA-NFL-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HND/indicators/DT.NFL.MIDA.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Net financial flows received by the borrower during the year are disbursements of loans and credits less repayments of principal.

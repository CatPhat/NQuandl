Tertiary. Male is the total number of years of schooling which a child of a certain age can expect to receive in the future, assuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any particular age is equal to the current enrollment ratio for that age. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates.

Definitions for each indicator follow.  Total debt service (TDS) shows the debt service payments on total long-term debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of IMF credit, and interest on short-term debt only. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments in the year specified.  Exports of goods, services and income is the sum of goods (merchandise) exports, exports of (nonfactor) services and income (factor) receipts.  Data are in current U.S. dollars.  Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices.

That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Commitments Index, all service sectors (0 least liberal to 100 most liberal)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:25:09.387Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:46:36.740Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:46:36.740Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":333255,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GAB_IC_CNS_LIC_DURS","name":"Gabon: Days to Obtain Operating License","urlize_name":"Gabon-Days-to-Obtain-Operating-License","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GAB/indicators/IC.CNS.LIC.DURS?per_page=1000","description":"\nDays to Obtain Operating License","created_at":"2012-01-05T18:39:31.139Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:54:39.309Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2277027,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DOM_WP11629_3_8","name":"Dominican Republic: 3+ withdrawals from account in a typical month, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Dominican-Republic-3-withdrawals-from-account-in-a-typical-month-income-quintiles-I-lowest-and-II-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DOM/indicators/WP11629.3.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make 3 or more withdrawals from their personal account(s) in a typical month.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

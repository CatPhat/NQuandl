Series numbers with two digits (10,20) refer to data compiled following the 1968 SNA national accounts methodology, while series numbers with three digits (100, 200, etc) refer to data compiled using the 1993 SNA national accounts methodology, and series numbers with four digits (1000, 1100, etc) refer to data compiled using the 2008 SNA national accounts methodology. In addition to different methodologies, different series numbers are used when data are reported in different currencies, fiscal years, or by different sources. Furthermore, data are stored under a new series number whenever there are significant changes in compilation practices which make the time series no longer comparable.","created_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:21.513Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:36.070Z","refreshed_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:36.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"1984-12-31","column_names":["Date","GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT","Plus: Property income - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Property income - from the rest of the world","Less: Property income - to the rest of the world","Equals: GROSS NATIONAL INCOME","Plus: Current transfers - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Current transfers - from the rest of the world","Less: Current transfers - to the rest of the world","Equals: GROSS NATIONAL DISPOSABLE INCOME","Less: Final consumption expenditure / Actual final consumption","Equals: SAVING; GROSS","Less: Gross capital formation","Equals: NET LENDING (+) / NET BORROWING (-) OF THE NATION","Less: Consumption of fixed capital","Equals: NET NATIONAL INCOME","Equals: NET NATIONAL DISPOSABLE INCOME","Equals: SAVING; NET","Plus: Compensation of employees - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Compensation of employees - from the rest of the world","Less: Compensation of employees - to the rest of the world","Sum of Compensation of employees and property income - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Sum of Compensation of employees and property income - from the rest of the world","Less: Sum of Compensation of employees and property income - to the rest of the world"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":10925337,"source_id":5449,"source_code":"UNDATA","code":"COM_AAKC_SLB","name":"Trade in Articles Of Apparel, Accessories, Knit Or Crochet - Solomon Islands","urlize_name":"Trade-in-Articles-Of-Apparel-Accessories-Knit-Or-Crochet-Solomon-Islands","display_url":null,"description":"Trade in Articles Of Apparel, Accessories, Knit Or Crochet - Solomon Islands.

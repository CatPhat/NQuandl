The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T22:15:06.755Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T07:51:46.378Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T07:51:46.378Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7645670,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5706EUROPEANUNIONTOTAL56MAIZE","name":"Emissions Agriculture Burning Crop_Residues: Maize - European Union + (Total)","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Burning-Crop_Residues-Maize-European-Union-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Burning_crop_residues_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:07:35.366Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T07:44:57.126Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T07:44:57.126Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Non-fertilizer use (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7795018,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_185RUSSIANFEDERATION2764MARINEFISHOTHER","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Marine Fish, Other - Russian Federation","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Marine-Fish-Other-Russian-Federation","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

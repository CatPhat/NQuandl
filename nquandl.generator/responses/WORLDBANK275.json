Secondary is the number of female teachers at the secondary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the secondary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nSecondary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:58:19.170Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:39.660Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:39.660Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6534907,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRN_WP11628_9_1_6","name":"Iran, Islamic Rep.: 0 deposits into & withdrawals from account in a typical month, primary education or less (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Iran-Islamic-Rep-0-deposits-into-withdrawals-from-account-in-a-typical-month-primary-education-or-less-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRN/indicators/WP11628_9.1.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who do not deposit into or withdraw from their personal account(s) in a typical month.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.

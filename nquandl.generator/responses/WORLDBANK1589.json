Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\nNet bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Korea, Rep.

Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year. Every effort was made in cases of discrepancy across the three agencies to obtain approval from the country on a final indicator value.  \nHIV positive pregnant women receiving antiretrovirals, using WHO/UNAIDS methodology (%)","created_at":"2012-01-05T06:52:24.313Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:40:56.473Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:40:56.473Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":266044,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_MYS_POP_3539_PRI_MA","name":"Cameroon: population in thousand, 35-39, male, primary","urlize_name":"Cameroon-population-in-thousand-35-39-male-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/MYS.POP.3539.PRI.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 35-39, male, primary is the total number of males age 35-39 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 35-39, male, primary","created_at":"2012-01-04T08:23:14.377Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:55:43.502Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:55:43.502Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6519107,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GHA_REM_GEN_Q5","name":"Ghana: (%) Generosity of Private Transfers - 5th 20%","urlize_name":"Ghana-Generosity-of-Private-Transfers-5th-20","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GHA/indicators/rem.gen_q5?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the (%) Generosity of Private Transfers for 5th 20% \n(%) Generosity of Private Transfers - 5th 20% ","created_at":"2013-05-17T06:18:32.310Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T10:21:39.815Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T10:21:39.815Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6518955,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GHA_MYS_PROP_1519_PRI_MA","name":"Ghana: proportion, 15-19, male, primary","urlize_name":"Ghana-proportion-15-19-male-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GHA/indicators/MYS.PROP.1519.PRI.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 15-19, male, primary is the proportion of the male population age 15-19 with primary education.\nproportion, 15-19, male, primary","created_at":"2013-05-17T06:11:25.487Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:11:32.274Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:11:32.274Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":342782,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GHA_PV_PER_RNK","name":"Ghana: Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Percentile Rank","urlize_name":"Ghana-Political-Stability-and-Absence-of-Violence-Terrorism-Percentile-Rank","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GHA/indicators/PV.PER.RNK?per_page=1000","description":"Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism captures perceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically-motivated violence and terrorism.\nPolitical Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Percentile Rank","created_at":"2012-01-05T23:11:40.212Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:39:04.715Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:39:04.715Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6578867,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NER_SE_PRE_TCHR_FE","name":"Niger: Teaching staff in pre-primary.

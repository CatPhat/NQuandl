Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

floods and extreme temperatures is the annual average percentage of the population that is affected by natural disasters classified as either droughts, floods, or extreme temperature events.  A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nSecondary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-04T03:36:42.929Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:03.149Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:03.149Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1979-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2245491,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TTO_BAR_SEC_ICMP_5054_FE_ZS","name":"Trinidad and Tobago: percentage of population (15+), 50-54, female, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Trinidad-and-Tobago-percentage-of-population-15-50-54-female-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TTO/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.5054.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 50-54, female, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the female population age 50-54 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 50-54, female, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:55:31.160Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:25.378Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:25.378Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":220621,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BHS_SP_POP_AG12_FE_UN","name":"Bahamas, The: Population, aged 12, female","urlize_name":"Bahamas-The-Population-aged-12-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BHS/indicators/SP.POP.AG12.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 12, female","created_at":"2012-01-03T00:47:05.071Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:56.037Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:56.037Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2148210,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"URY_MYS_POP_4549_SEC_MF","name":"Uruguay: population in thousand, 45-49, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Uruguay-population-in-thousand-45-49-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/URY/indicators/MYS.POP.4549.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 45-49, total, secondary is the total number of people age 45-49 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 45-49, total, secondary","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:58:22.848Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:53.696Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:53.696Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2051139,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVK_WP11631_4_10","name":"Slovak Republic: Bank agent is main mode of deposit into account, rural (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Slovak-Republic-Bank-agent-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-rural-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVK/indicators/WP11631.4.10?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is from some other person who is associated with one's bank or financial institution (% living in an urban area, age 15+ , with a formal account)\nBank agent is main mode of deposit into account, rural (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-07T19:08:25.529Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:29.374Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:29.374Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":359060,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GTM_MYS_MEA_YSCH_3034_FE","name":"Guatemala: mean years of schooling, 30 - 34, female","urlize_name":"Guatemala-mean-years-of-schooling-30-34-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GTM/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.3034.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 30 - 34, female is the mean years of schooling of the female population age 30-34.\nmean years of schooling, 30 - 34, female","created_at":"2012-01-06T07:51:10.432Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:25.582Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:25.582Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6488979,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_DT_DOD_DSTO_CD_OT","name":"Uganda: 046_T1_Gross External Debt, Other.debt.liabilities (ST, Oth.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

Primary. Never in school. Rural is the percentage of rural out-of-school primary-school-age children who have never attended school and are not likely to enter school in the future. Since no survey can say definitively that a school-age person will never attend school, this is a probabilistic indicator. The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

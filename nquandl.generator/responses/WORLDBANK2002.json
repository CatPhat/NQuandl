It is based on a diagnostic framework developed with a view to assessing the capacity of national statistical systems and monitoring progress in statistical development over time. The framework has three dimensions: statistical methodology; source data; and periodicity and timeliness. For each dimension, a country is scored against specific criteria, using information available from the World Bank, IMF, UN, UNESCO, and WHO. A composite score for each dimension and an overall score combining all three dimensions are derived for each country on a scale of 0-100. A score of 100 indicates that the country meets all the criteria.\nOverall level of statistical capacity (scale 0 - 100)","created_at":"2013-05-17T00:20:26.143Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T16:45:54.315Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T16:45:54.315Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2206698,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TJK_SP_POP_1218_FE_UN","name":"Tajikistan: Population, aged 12-18, female","urlize_name":"Tajikistan-Population-aged-12-18-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TJK/indicators/SP.POP.1218.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12-18, female is the total number of females age 12-18.\nPopulation, aged 12-18, female","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:11:38.852Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T16:45:54.381Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T16:45:54.381Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":355262,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GTM_SL_UEM_TOTL_MA_ZS","name":"Guatemala: Unemployment, male (% of male labor force)","urlize_name":"Guatemala-Unemployment-male-of-male-labor-force","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GTM/indicators/SL.UEM.TOTL.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Unemployment refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.

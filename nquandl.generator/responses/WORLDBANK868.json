Primary is the number of female teachers at the primary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the primary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nPrimary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-07T15:36:05.749Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:19.043Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:19.043Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2209125,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CUB_UIS_FOSEP_56_F140_F","name":"Cuba: Percentage of female tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in education","urlize_name":"Cuba-Percentage-of-female-tertiary-enrolments-ISCED-5-and-6-in-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CUB/indicators/UIS.FOSEP.56.F140.F?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of female tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in education is the percentage of all female tertiary students who are enrolled in education programmes.\nPercentage of female tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in education","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:24:16.192Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:55:18.540Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:55:18.540Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2157042,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COL_WP11669_8","name":"Colombia: Outstanding loan to pay school fees, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Colombia-Outstanding-loan-to-pay-school-fees-income-quintiles-I-lowest-and-II-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COL/indicators/WP11669.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out to pay for school fees (% in the first (lowest) and second income quintiles (0-40th percentile), age 15+)\nOutstanding loan to pay school fees, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T00:01:48.934Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:40.025Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:40.025Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6490328,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_MYS_POP_4564_SEC_MF","name":"Uganda: population in thousand, 45-64, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Uganda-population-in-thousand-45-64-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/MYS.POP.4564.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 45-64, total, secondary is the total number of people age 45-64 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 45-64, total, secondary","created_at":"2013-05-15T11:59:12.629Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:02.387Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:02.387Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6440058,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SUR_UIS_E_23_V_PU","name":"Suriname: Enrolment in total secondary.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

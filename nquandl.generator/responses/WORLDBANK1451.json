(For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (current LCU)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:19:01.231Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T04:56:03.432Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T04:56:03.432Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2199296,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRT_MYS_PROP_3034_PRI_MA","name":"Portugal: proportion, 30 - 34, male, primary","urlize_name":"Portugal-proportion-30-34-male-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRT/indicators/MYS.PROP.3034.PRI.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 30-34, male, primary is the proportion of the male population age 30-34 with primary education.\nproportion, 30 - 34, male, primary","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:30:25.778Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:51:01.541Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:51:01.541Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":341429,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GIN_TX_VAL_COM2_CD_WB","name":"Guinea: Exports of commodity 2 (current US$)","urlize_name":"Guinea-Exports-of-commodity-2-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GIN/indicators/TX.VAL.COM2.CD.WB?per_page=1000","description":"Exports of commodity 2 in current US dollars and fob basis. \nExports of commodity 2 (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-05T22:28:53.331Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:20:02.985Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:20:02.985Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1986-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":286933,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DEU_BAR_TER_CMPT_2024_ZS","name":"Germany: percentage of population (15+), 20-24, total, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"Germany-percentage-of-population-15-20-24-total-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DEU/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.2024.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 20-24, total, completed tertiary is the percentage of people age 20-24 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 20-24, total, completed tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-04T18:31:21.483Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:06.113Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:33:06.113Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2139204,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZAF_DT_TDS_DECT_CD_GG","name":"South Africa: 070_T3_Debt-Service Payment Schedule, General.Government (GG) (Immediate quarter)","urlize_name":"South-Africa-070_T3_Debt-Service-Payment-Schedule-General-Government-GG-Immediate-quarter","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZAF/indicators/DT.TDS.DECT.CD.GG?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n070_T3_Debt-Service Payment Schedule, General.Government (GG) (Immediate quarter)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:16:25.358Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T22:15:57.186Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-11T22:15:57.186Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-06-30","to_date":"2013-06-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6616700,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_SP_POP_AG07_FE_IN","name":"Rwanda: Age population, age 07, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Rwanda-Age-population-age-07-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RWA/indicators/SP.POP.AG07.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 07, female, interpolated","created_at":"2013-05-22T01:13:13.118Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:36:25.525Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:36:25.525Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6613496,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_GB_REV_XAGT_CN","name":"Rwanda: Central government revenue excluding all grants  (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Rwanda-Central-government-revenue-excluding-all-grants-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RWA/indicators/GB.REV.XAGT.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Central government revenue excluding all grants.

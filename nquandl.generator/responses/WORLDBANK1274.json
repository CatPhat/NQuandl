Primary to secondary. Male is the total number of years of schooling which a child of a certain age can expect to receive in the future, assuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any particular age is equal to the current enrollment ratio for that age. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:49:10.166Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:21:41.458Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:21:41.458Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":532939,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NZL_SH_XPD_PRIV_CD","name":"New Zealand: Health expenditure, private","urlize_name":"New-Zealand-Health-expenditure-private","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NZL/indicators/SH.XPD.PRIV.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Private health expenditure includes direct household (out-of-pocket) spending, private insurance, charitable donations, and direct service payments by private corporations.\nHealth expenditure, private (current US$)","created_at":"2012-03-05T13:31:02.090Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T17:16:09.813Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2092523,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUS_WP11630_2_10","name":"Australia: Bank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, rural (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Australia-Bank-teller-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-rural-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUS/indicators/WP11630.2.10?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is over the counter in a branch of one's bank or financial institution (% living in an urban area, age 15+ , with a formal account)\nBank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, rural (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:15:05.186Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:47:52.597Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:47:52.597Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":387228,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ISL_SP_POP_AG11_FE_UN","name":"Iceland: Population, aged 11, female","urlize_name":"Iceland-Population-aged-11-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ISL/indicators/SP.POP.AG11.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 11, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 11, female","created_at":"2012-01-06T21:59:32.659Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:01:29.223Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:01:29.223Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":238973,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BRA_NY_ADJ_DNGY_GN_ZS","name":"Brazil: Adjusted savings: energy depletion (% of GNI)","urlize_name":"Brazil-Adjusted-savings-energy-depletion-of-GNI","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BRA/indicators/NY.ADJ.DNGY.GN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Energy depletion is the ratio of the value of the stock of energy resources to the remaining reserve lifetime (capped at 25 years).

The indicator is based on UNESCOâ€™s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nPrimary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-04T15:39:27.179Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:28.022Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:28.022Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1974-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6503220,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"WSM_SL_FAM_WORK_ZS","name":"Samoa: Contributing family workers, total (% of total employed)","urlize_name":"Samoa-Contributing-family-workers-total-of-total-employed","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/WSM/indicators/SL.FAM.WORK.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Contributing family workers are those workers who hold \"self-employment jobs\" as own-account workers in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same household.\nContributing family workers, total (% of total employed)","created_at":"2013-05-16T01:04:55.019Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:02:20.148Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:02:20.148Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2001-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2146689,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UKR_SP_POP_AG11_FE_UN","name":"Ukraine: Population, aged 11, female","urlize_name":"Ukraine-Population-aged-11-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UKR/indicators/SP.POP.AG11.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 11, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 11, female","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:50:01.265Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:22.417Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:22.417Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2164700,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BHR_WP11668_9","name":"Bahrain: Outstanding loan for home construction, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Bahrain-Outstanding-loan-for-home-construction-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BHR/indicators/WP11668.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out to purchase materials or services to build, extend, or renovate their home or apartment (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nOutstanding loan for home construction, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T00:56:46.230Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:35.675Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:35.675Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2245112,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AGO_WP11630_2_4","name":"Angola: Bank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","urlize_name":"Angola-Bank-teller-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-young-adults-with-an-account-age-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AGO/indicators/WP11630.2.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is over the counter in a branch of one's bank or financial institution (% ages 15-24, with a formal account)\nBank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:53:11.049Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:44.339Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:58:44.339Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":360269,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GTM_NYGDPMKTPCD","name":"Guatemala: GDP, current US$, millions","urlize_name":"Guatemala-GDP-current-US-millions","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GTM/indicators/NYGDPMKTPCD?per_page=1000","description":"GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock, total","created_at":"2012-01-05T16:30:28.909Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T20:50:10.956Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-21T20:50:10.956Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":395344,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JAM_EG_USE_ELEC_KH_PC","name":"Jamaica: Electric power consumption (kWh per capita)","urlize_name":"Jamaica-Electric-power-consumption-kWh-per-capita","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/JAM/indicators/EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC?per_page=1000","description":"Electric power consumption measures the production of power plants and combined heat and power plants less transmission, distribution, and transformation losses and own use by heat and power plants.\nElectric power consumption (kWh per capita)","created_at":"2012-01-07T02:11:51.631Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:13:27.894Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:13:27.894Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2213794,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SDN_EG_ELC_PETR_ZS","name":"Sudan: Electricity production from oil sources (% of total)","urlize_name":"Sudan-Electricity-production-from-oil-sources-of-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SDN/indicators/EG.ELC.PETR.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Sources of electricity refer to the inputs used to generate electricity.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA.

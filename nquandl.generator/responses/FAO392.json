The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:10:21.533Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:43:34.205Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:43:34.205Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Non-fertilizer use (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7657544,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_112JORDAN987WOOLGREASY","name":"Prices Indices: Wool, greasy - Jordan","urlize_name":"Prices-Indices-Wool-greasy-Jordan","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Price_Indices_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T20:29:27.083Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:44:57.702Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:44:57.702Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7647266,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5803SMALLISLANDDEVELOPINGSTATESTOTAL800AGAVEFIBRESNES","name":"Value of Production: Agave Fibres Nes - Small Island Developing States + (Total)","urlize_name":"Value-of-Production-Agave-Fibres-Nes-Small-Island-Developing-States-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Value_of_Production_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

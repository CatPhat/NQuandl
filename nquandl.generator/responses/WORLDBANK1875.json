The index ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing better performance. Data are from Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. 2009 round of surveys covered more than 5,000 country assessments by nearly 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis.

It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States.\nPPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate ratio","created_at":"2012-01-04T07:21:37.919Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:57:22.734Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:57:22.734Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":262751,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CIV_NE_IMP_GNFS_KN","name":"Cote d'Ivoire: Imports of goods and services (constant LCU)","urlize_name":"Cote-d-Ivoire-Imports-of-goods-and-services-constant-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CIV/indicators/NE.IMP.GNFS.KN?per_page=1000","description":"Imports of goods and services represent the value of all goods and other market services received from the rest of the world.

The index ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing better performance. Data are from Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. 2009 round of surveys covered more than 5,000 country assessments by nearly 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis.

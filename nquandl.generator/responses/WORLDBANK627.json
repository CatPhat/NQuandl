Denominator: Estimated number of HIV-infected pregnant women in the last 12 months.  Ranges are presented for countries with low and concentrated epidemics.  The purpose of this indicator is to assess progress in preventing vertical transmission of HIV.  All data reflect values representing 12 month period ending December 2007 which have been reconciled between reporting country and UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF, unless otherwise noted.  All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year. Every effort was made in cases of discrepancy across the three agencies to obtain approval from the country on a final indicator value.  \nHIV positive pregnant women receiving antiretrovirals, using WHO/UNAIDS methodology (%; low estimate)","created_at":"2013-05-22T01:07:00.720Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T20:48:43.305Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-21T20:48:43.305Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":200227,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_EN_ATM_GHGO_KT_CE","name":"Austria: Other greenhouse gas emissions, HFC, PFC and SF6 (thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent)","urlize_name":"Austria-Other-greenhouse-gas-emissions-HFC-PFC-and-SF6-thousand-metric-tons-of-CO2-equivalent","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUT/indicators/EN.ATM.GHGO.KT.CE?per_page=1000","description":"Other greenhouse gas emissions are by-product emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.\nOther greenhouse gas emissions, HFC, PFC and SF6 (thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent)","created_at":"2012-01-02T16:56:34.090Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T21:18:32.465Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T21:18:32.465Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2198038,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ROU_SI_SS_GEN_Q2","name":"Romania: (%) Generosity of Social Security - 2nd 20%","urlize_name":"Romania-Generosity-of-Social-Security-2nd-20","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ROU/indicators/si_ss.gen_q2?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the (%) Generosity of Social Security for 2nd 20% \n(%) Generosity of Social Security - 2nd 20% ","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:23:22.611Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T23:33:48.907Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T23:33:48.907Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":334101,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GAB_MYS_POP_25UP_NED_FE","name":"Gabon: population in thousand, 25+, female, no education","urlize_name":"Gabon-population-in-thousand-25-female-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GAB/indicators/MYS.POP.25UP.NED.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 25+, female, no education is the total number of females over age 25 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 25+, female, no education","created_at":"2012-01-05T19:03:48.615Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:35:45.747Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:35:45.747Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":480980,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MKD_IS_AIR_PSGR","name":"Macedonia, FYR: Air transport, passengers carried","urlize_name":"Macedonia-FYR-Air-transport-passengers-carried","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MKD/indicators/IS.AIR.PSGR?per_page=1000","description":"Air passengers carried include both domestic and international aircraft passengers of air carriers registered in the country.\nAir transport, passengers carried","created_at":"2012-01-10T18:35:43.561Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:16.031Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:16.031Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":252611,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CHL_BAR_SEC_SCHL_3539_FE","name":"Chile: average years of secondary schooling, 35-39, female","urlize_name":"Chile-average-years-of-secondary-schooling-35-39-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CHL/indicators/BAR.SEC.SCHL.3539.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of secondary schooling, 35-39, female is the average years of secondary education completed among females age 35-39. \naverage years of secondary schooling, 35-39, female","created_at":"2012-01-04T03:14:01.941Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:59:48.400Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:59:48.400Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2066252,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ERI_UIS_E_56_F300_F","name":"Eritrea: Enrolment in social sciences, business and law.

Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the import volume indexes (lines 73) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nImport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-07T16:06:16.516Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.766Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.766Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2228071,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLV_TX_VAL_MRCH_CD_WT","name":"El Salvador: Merchandise exports (current US$)","urlize_name":"El-Salvador-Merchandise-exports-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLV/indicators/TX.VAL.MRCH.CD.WT?per_page=1000","description":"Merchandise exports show the f.o.b. value of goods provided to the rest of the world valued in current U.S. dollars.\nMerchandise exports (current US$)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:13:33.021Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.810Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.810Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":532487,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NOR_SP_POP_1016_MA_UN","name":"Norway: Population, aged 10-16, male","urlize_name":"Norway-Population-aged-10-16-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NOR/indicators/SP.POP.1016.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 10-16, male is the total number of males age 10-16.\nPopulation, aged 10-16, male","created_at":"2012-03-05T13:27:36.986Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.840Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.840Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2110058,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRL_DP_DOD_DLCD_CR_L1_CG_CD","name":"Ireland: 042.Currency and deposits (PSDCG, LT, <1yr) US$","urlize_name":"Ireland-042-Currency-and-deposits-PSDCG-LT-1yr-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRL/indicators/DP.DOD.DLCD.CR.L1.CG.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n042.Currency and deposits (PSDCG, LT, <1yr) US$","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:53:23.967Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.914Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:37.914Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-03-31","to_date":"2014-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2171469,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLB_SP_POP_1419_TO_UN","name":"Solomon Islands: Population, aged 14-19, total","urlize_name":"Solomon-Islands-Population-aged-14-19-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLB/indicators/SP.POP.1419.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 14-19, total is the total population age 14-19.\nPopulation, aged 14-19, total","created_at":"2012-08-09T01:46:51.282Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:38.027Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:39:38.027Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":273961,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CPV_BX_GSR_FCTY_CD","name":"Cape Verde: Primary income receipts (BoP, current US$)","urlize_name":"Cape-Verde-Primary-income-receipts-BoP-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CPV/indicators/BX.GSR.FCTY.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Primary income receipts refer to employee compensation paid to resident workers working abroad and investment income (receipts on direct investment, portfolio investment, other investments, and receipts on reserve assets).

Data are from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey, conducted for 30 years in collaboration with 150 partner institutes. The 2009 round included more than 13,000 respondents from 133 countries. Sampling follows a dual stratification based on company size and the sector of activity. Data are collected online or through in-person interviews. Responses are aggregated using sector-weighted averaging. The data for the latest year are combined with the data for the previous year to create a two-year moving average. Respondents evaluated the efficiency of customs procedures in their country. The lowest score (1) rates the customs procedure as extremely inefficient, and the highest score (7) as extremely efficient.\nBurden of customs procedure, WEF (1=extremely inefficient to 7=extremely efficient)","created_at":"2012-08-09T10:38:16.949Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:55:26.652Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:55:26.652Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6419878,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SAS_AG_CON_FERT_PT_ZS","name":"South Asia: Fertilizer consumption (% of fertilizer production)","urlize_name":"South-Asia-Fertilizer-consumption-of-fertilizer-production","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SAS/indicators/AG.CON.FERT.PT.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Fertilizer consumption measures the quantity of plant nutrients used per unit of arable land.

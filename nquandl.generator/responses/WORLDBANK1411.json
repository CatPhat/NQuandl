When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

Tariff line data were matched to Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) revision 3 codes to define commodity groups and import weights. To the extent possible, specific rates have been converted to their ad valorem equivalent rates and have been included in the calculation of weighted mean tariffs. Import weights were calculated using the United Nations Statistics Division's Commodity Trade (Comtrade) database. Effectively applied tariff rates at the six- and eight-digit product level are averaged for products in each commodity group. When the effectively applied rate is unavailable, the most favored nation rate is used instead.\nTariff rate, applied, weighted mean, all products (%)","created_at":"2012-01-02T14:39:32.355Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:15:33.604Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:15:33.604Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":230769,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BOL_SP_POP_AG16_TO_UN","name":"Bolivia: Population, aged 16, total","urlize_name":"Bolivia-Population-aged-16-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BOL/indicators/SP.POP.AG16.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 16, total refers to the total population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 16, total","created_at":"2012-01-03T05:57:02.847Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:52:30.949Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:52:30.949Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6462974,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SYR_UIS_REPP_23_GPV_G1_M","name":"Syrian Arab Republic: Percentage of repeaters in secondary.

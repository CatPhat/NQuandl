To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2012-08-09T11:02:09.366Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:45:55.770Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:45:55.770Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1967-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":310266,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ERI_SP_POP_0509_TO_UN","name":"Eritrea: Population, aged 5- 9, total","urlize_name":"Eritrea-Population-aged-5-9-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ERI/indicators/SP.POP.0509.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 5-9, total is the total population age 5-9.\nPopulation, aged 5- 9, total","created_at":"2012-01-05T07:03:19.815Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:45:55.806Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:45:55.806Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2049555,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NLD_BM_GSR_GNFS_CD","name":"Netherlands: Imports of goods and services (BoP, current US$)","urlize_name":"Netherlands-Imports-of-goods-and-services-BoP-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NLD/indicators/BM.GSR.GNFS.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Imports of goods and services comprise all transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world involving a change of ownership from nonresidents to residents of general merchandise, nonmonetary gold, and services.

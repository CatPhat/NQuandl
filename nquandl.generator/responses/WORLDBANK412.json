PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2005 international dollars.\nGDP per capita, PPP (constant 2005 international $)","created_at":"2012-01-10T15:37:34.909Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:58:27.837Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:58:27.837Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6597907,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PER_WP11646_2","name":"Peru: Saved for future expenses in the past year, male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Peru-Saved-for-future-expenses-in-the-past-year-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PER/indicators/WP11646.2?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved for expenses in the future such as education, a wedding, or a big purchase in the past 12 months (% male, age 15+)\nSaved for future expenses in the past year, male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-21T12:04:39.709Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:46:45.279Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:46:45.279Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":195561,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARG_SE_PRM_EPCR_MA_ZS","name":"Argentina: Expected primary completion rate, male (% of population at theoretical entrance age)","urlize_name":"Argentina-Expected-primary-completion-rate-male-of-population-at-theoretical-entrance-age","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARG/indicators/SE.PRM.EPCR.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Expected primary completion rate.

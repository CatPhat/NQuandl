Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end.

When data on number of tourists are not available, the number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members, is shown instead. Sources and collection methods for arrivals differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police, immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in hotels. Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries. The data on inbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals, not to the number of people traveling.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-02T07:00:20.591Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T11:11:19.451Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T11:11:19.451Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6431848,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SRB_BAR_TER_CMPT_7074_ZS","name":"Serbia: percentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"Serbia-percentage-of-population-15-70-74-total-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SRB/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.7074.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 70-74, total, completed tertiary is the percentage of people age 70-74 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, completed tertiary","created_at":"2013-05-14T04:48:32.675Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:27:49.307Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:27:49.307Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2115747,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZAF_IC_TEL_DURS","name":"South Africa: Delay in obtaining a mainline telephone connection (days)","urlize_name":"South-Africa-Delay-in-obtaining-a-mainline-telephone-connection-days","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZAF/indicators/IC.TEL.DURS?per_page=1000","description":"Delay for firm in obtaining a telephone connection is the average actual delay in days that firms experience when obtaining a telephone connection, measured from the day the establishment applied to the day it received the service or approval.  \nDelay in obtaining a mainline telephone connection (days)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:22:29.549Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:15:29.038Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:15:29.038Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":202657,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_MYS_PROP_4044_SEC_FE","name":"Austria: proportion, 40-44, female, secondary","urlize_name":"Austria-proportion-40-44-female-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUT/indicators/MYS.PROP.4044.SEC.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 40-44, female, secondary is the proportion of the female population age 40-44 with secondary education.\nproportion, 40-44, female, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-02T17:51:16.546Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.580Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.580Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6550250,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LBR_WP11646_8","name":"Liberia: Saved for future expenses in the past year, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Liberia-Saved-for-future-expenses-in-the-past-year-income-quintiles-I-lowest-and-II-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LBR/indicators/WP11646.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved for expenses in the future such as education, a wedding, or a big purchase in the past 12 months (% in the first (lowest) and second income quintiles (0-40th percentile), age 15+)\nSaved for future expenses in the past year, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-19T05:08:32.504Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:33:49.669Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:33:49.669Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":415697,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KGZ_SE_TER_ENRL_FE_ZS","name":"Kyrgyz Republic: Girls enrollment share (%), tertiary","urlize_name":"Kyrgyz-Republic-Girls-enrollment-share-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KGZ/indicators/SE.TER.ENRL.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of female students.

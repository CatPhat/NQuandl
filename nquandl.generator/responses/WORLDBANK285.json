Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI).

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2013-05-14T22:11:20.648Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:21:53.072Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:21:53.072Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":415650,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KGZ_SE_SEC_PRIV_ZS","name":"Kyrgyz Republic: School enrollment, secondary, private (% of total secondary)","urlize_name":"Kyrgyz-Republic-School-enrollment-secondary-private-of-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KGZ/indicators/SE.SEC.PRIV.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of private enrolment.

The calculation takes into account whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern as well as costs and the loss in value due to the time spent closing down. If the business keeps operating, no value is lost on the initial claim, set at 100 cents on the dollar. If it does not, the initial 100 cents on the dollar are reduced to 70 cents on the dollar. Then the official costs of the insolvency procedure are deducted (1 cent for each percentage of the initial value). Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is taken into account, including the loss of value due to depreciation of the hotel furniture. Consistent with international accounting practice, the depreciation rate for furniture is taken to be 20%. The furniture is assumed to account for a quarter of the total value of assets.

For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.  \nDebt on Concessional terms to GDP (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-10T18:49:25.876Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:52:34.030Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:52:34.030Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":521801,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NAM_BAR_TER_CMPT_7074_ZS","name":"Namibia: percentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"Namibia-percentage-of-population-15-70-74-total-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NAM/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.7074.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 70-74, total, completed tertiary is the percentage of people age 70-74 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 70-74, total, completed tertiary","created_at":"2012-03-05T11:37:35.652Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:50:22.882Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:50:22.882Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2081095,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SGP_BAR_TER_ICMP_6064_FE_ZS","name":"Singapore: percentage of population (15+), 60-64, female, incomplete tertiary","urlize_name":"Singapore-percentage-of-population-15-60-64-female-incomplete-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SGP/indicators/BAR.TER.ICMP.6064.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 60-64, female, incomplete tertiary is the percentage of the female population age 60-64 who did not complete tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 60-64, female, incomplete tertiary","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:06:24.346Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:15.888Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:15.888Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6614358,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_IT_NET_SUB_CN","name":"Rwanda: Fixed broadband Internet monthly subscription (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Rwanda-Fixed-broadband-Internet-monthly-subscription-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RWA/indicators/IT.NET.SUB.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Fixed (Wired) broadband Internet monthly subscription is the monthly subscription charge for fixed (wired) broadband Internet service.

Primary. Never in school. Quintile 1 is the percentage of quintile 1 out-of-school primary-school-age children who have never attended school and are not likely to enter school in the future. Since no survey can say definitively that a school-age person will never attend school, this is a probabilistic indicator. The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

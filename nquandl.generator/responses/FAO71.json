Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T04:44:07.398Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:47.801Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:47.801Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1963-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7841837,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5815LOWINCOMEFOODDEFICITCOUNTRIESTOTAL5058ENTERICFERMENTATION","name":"Emissions Agriculture: Enteric Fermentation - Low Income Food Deficit Countries + (Total)","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Enteric-Fermentation-Low-Income-Food-Deficit-Countries-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Agriculture_total_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:43:08.679Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:45:44.084Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:45:44.084Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7706803,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_132MALDIVES550CURRANTS","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Currants - Maldives","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Currants-Maldives","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

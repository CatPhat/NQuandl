A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-02T19:06:04.553Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:12:30.206Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:12:30.206Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":351257,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRC_BAR_PRM_ICMP_6569_ZS","name":"Greece: percentage of population (15+), 65-69, total, incomplete primary","urlize_name":"Greece-percentage-of-population-15-65-69-total-incomplete-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRC/indicators/BAR.PRM.ICMP.6569.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 65-69, total, incomplete primary is the percentage of the population age 65-69 who did not complete primary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 65-69, total, incomplete primary","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:48:51.316Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:08:04.477Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:08:04.477Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":249290,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CAF_NE_GDI_TOTL_ZS","name":"Central African Republic: Gross capital formation (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Central-African-Republic-Gross-capital-formation-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CAF/indicators/NE.GDI.TOTL.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates.

Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

(For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-05T00:14:35.711Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:10:31.353Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:10:31.353Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1988-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":391355,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ISL_NY_GNP_PCAP_CD","name":"Iceland: GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","urlize_name":"Iceland-GNI-per-capita-Atlas-method-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ISL/indicators/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD?per_page=1000","description":"GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population.

GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

migrant stock is the number of people born in a country other than that in which they live. It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:56:25.154Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:19:35.836Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:19:35.836Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2084745,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BOL_ALLSP_CDG_CI","name":"Bolivia: Concentration index - All Social Protection","urlize_name":"Bolivia-Concentration-index-All-Social-Protection","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BOL/indicators/allsp.cdg_ci?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Concentration index for All Social Protection\nConcentration index - All Social Protection","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:28:29.237Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T23:59:14.376Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T23:59:14.376Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2093529,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUR_WP11646_10","name":"Turkey: Saved for future expenses in the past year, rural (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Turkey-Saved-for-future-expenses-in-the-past-year-rural-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUR/indicators/WP11646.10?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved for expenses in the future such as education, a wedding, or a big purchase in the past 12 months (% living in an urban area, age 15+ )\nSaved for future expenses in the past year, rural (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:21:26.345Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:31:29.969Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:31:29.969Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":187180,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ALB_IC_ELC_DURS","name":"Albania: Delay in obtaining an electrical connection (days)","urlize_name":"Albania-Delay-in-obtaining-an-electrical-connection-days","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ALB/indicators/IC.ELC.DURS?per_page=1000","description":"Delay in obtaining an electrical connection is the average wait, in days, experienced to obtain an electrical connection from the day an establishment applies for it to the day it receives the service.\nDelay in obtaining an electrical connection (days)","created_at":"2012-01-02T08:47:19.075Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:03:22.346Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:03:22.346Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2002-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":337632,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_DT_TDS_DECT_CD_1318","name":"Georgia: 175_T3_Debt-Service Payment Schedule, Total (13-18 months)","urlize_name":"Georgia-175_T3_Debt-Service-Payment-Schedule-Total-13-18-months","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/DT.TDS.DECT.CD.1318?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n175_T3_Debt-Service Payment Schedule, Total (13-18 months)","created_at":"2012-01-05T20:27:26.335Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T20:51:11.284Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T20:51:11.284Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-03-31","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":277914,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CUB_SP_POP_1216_TO_UN","name":"Cuba: Population, aged 12-16, total","urlize_name":"Cuba-Population-aged-12-16-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CUB/indicators/SP.POP.1216.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12-16, total is the total population age 12-16.\nPopulation, aged 12-16, total","created_at":"2012-01-04T13:06:49.917Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T17:04:03.000Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T17:04:03.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":523751,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MOZ_MYS_PROP_5054_PRI_MF","name":"Mozambique: proportion, 50-54, total, primary","urlize_name":"Mozambique-proportion-50-54-total-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MOZ/indicators/MYS.PROP.5054.PRI.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 50-54, total, primary is the proportion of the population age 50-54 with primary education.\nproportion, 50-54, total, primary","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:09:02.429Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:31:32.500Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:31:32.500Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6502557,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CPV_UIS_T_2_GPV_F","name":"Cape Verde: Teaching staff in lower secondary.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

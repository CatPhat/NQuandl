Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year.

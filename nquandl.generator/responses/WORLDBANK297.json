It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-07T19:00:45.209Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:18:11.000Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:18:11.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":382827,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRN_BAR_SEC_ICMP_15UP_FE_ZS","name":"Iran, Islamic Rep.: percentage of population (15+), 15+, female, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Iran-Islamic-Rep-percentage-of-population-15-15-female-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRN/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.15UP.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 15+, female, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the female population over age 15 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 15+, female, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T19:47:25.936Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:49:28.514Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:49:28.514Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":377927,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IND_BAR_TER_CMPT_4549_ZS","name":"India: percentage of population (15+), 45-49, total, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"India-percentage-of-population-15-45-49-total-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IND/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.4549.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 45-49, total, completed tertiary is the percentage of people age 45-49 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 45-49, total, completed tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-06T16:43:28.673Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:49:41.890Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:49:41.890Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":198662,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_BAR_SEC_CMPT_5559_ZS","name":"Austria: percentage of population (15+), 55-59, total, completed secondary","urlize_name":"Austria-percentage-of-population-15-55-59-total-completed-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUT/indicators/BAR.SEC.CMPT.5559.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 55-59, total, completed secondary is the percentage of people age 55-59 who have completed secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 55-59, total, completed secondary","created_at":"2012-01-02T15:54:27.305Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:31:05.105Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:31:05.105Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6424846,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SEN_DT_ODA_DACD_PROD_AGRI_AGR_CD","name":"Senegal: Gross ODA aid disbursement for agriculture, DAC donors total (current US$)","urlize_name":"Senegal-Gross-ODA-aid-disbursement-for-agriculture-DAC-donors-total-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SEN/indicators/DT.ODA.DACD.PROD.AGRI.AGR.CD?per_page=1000","description":"This is described as agricultural policy and administrative management; agriculture development; agricultural water land resources; agricultural water resources; agricultural inputs; food crop production; industrial crops/export crops; livestock; agrarian reform; agricultural alternative development; agricultural extension; agricultural education/training;  agricultural research; agricultural services; plant and post-harvest protection and pest control; agricultural financial services, agricultural co-operatives and livestock services.

inbound tourists (overnight visitors) are the number of tourists who travel to a country other than that in which they have their usual residence, but outside their usual environment, for a period not

When data on number of tourists are not available, the number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members, is shown instead. Sources and collection methods for arrivals differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police, immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in hotels. Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries. The data on inbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals, not to the number of people traveling.

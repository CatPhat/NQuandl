Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2012-03-05T11:12:44.754Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:43:50.539Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:43:50.539Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1983-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6492490,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_WP11626_9","name":"Uganda: Debit card, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Uganda-Debit-card-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/WP11626.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults with a debit card (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nDebit card, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-15T12:44:20.785Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T16:44:48.318Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T16:44:48.318Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2027519,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TJK_RQ_NO_SRC","name":"Tajikistan: Regulatory Quality: Number of Sources","urlize_name":"Tajikistan-Regulatory-Quality-Number-of-Sources","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TJK/indicators/RQ.NO.SRC?per_page=1000","description":"Regulatory Quality captures perceptions of the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development.\nRegulatory Quality: Number of Sources","created_at":"2012-08-06T18:36:38.139Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:27:29.510Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:27:29.510Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2175393,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ROU_WP11623_4_9","name":"Romania: Account at a formal financial institution, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Romania-Account-at-a-formal-financial-institution-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ROU/indicators/WP11623_4.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults with an account (self or together with someone else) at a bank, credit union, another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives, microfinance institutions) or the post office (if applicable) including respondents who reported having a debit card (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nAccount at a formal financial institution, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T02:10:35.218Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:07:15.074Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:07:15.074Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":329113,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"FRA_NYGDPDISCCN","name":"France: GDP Discrepancy, current LCU, millions","urlize_name":"France-GDP-Discrepancy-current-LCU-millions","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/FRA/indicators/NYGDPDISCCN?per_page=1000","description":"A statistical discrepancy usually arises when the GDP components are estimated independently by industrial origin and by expenditure categories.

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

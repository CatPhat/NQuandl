Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:56:51.825Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:28:25.935Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:28:25.935Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7648287,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5000WORLDTOTAL136TAROCOCOYAM","name":"Value of Production: Taro (cocoyam) - World + (Total)","urlize_name":"Value-of-Production-Taro-cocoyam-World-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Value_of_Production_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2005 international dollars.\nGDP, PPP (constant 2005 international $)","created_at":"2013-05-20T14:50:33.647Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T02:47:16.657Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T02:47:16.657Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6571871,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MUS_GV_POLI_ST_NO","name":"Mauritius: Political Stability/No Violence (number of surveys/polls)","urlize_name":"Mauritius-Political-Stability-No-Violence-number-of-surveys-polls","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MUS/indicators/GV.POLI.ST.NO?per_page=1000","description":"See definition GV.POL.ST.ES.

CPI Score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts, and ranges between 10 (highly clean) and 0 (highly corrupt).  Confidence range provides a range of possible values of the CPI score. This reflects how a country's score may vary, depending on measurement precision. Nominally, with 5 percent probability the score is above this range and with another 5 percent it is below.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:47:59.293Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:57:37.921Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:57:37.921Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":413483,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_MYS_MEA_YSCH_65UP_MA","name":"Kenya: mean years of schooling, 65+, male","urlize_name":"Kenya-mean-years-of-schooling-65-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.65UP.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 65+, male is the mean years of schooling of the male population over age 65.\nmean years of schooling, 65+, male","created_at":"2012-01-07T09:19:48.622Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:54:52.430Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:54:52.430Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2235677,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAK_WP11623_4_2","name":"Pakistan: Account at a formal financial institution, male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Pakistan-Account-at-a-formal-financial-institution-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAK/indicators/WP11623_4.2?per_page=1000","description":"Account at a formal financial institution, male (% age 15+)\nAccount at a formal financial institution, male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:56:25.486Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:55:10.198Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:55:10.198Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2112982,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KWT_WP11633_3","name":"Kuwait: Electronic payments used to make payments, female (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Kuwait-Electronic-payments-used-to-make-payments-female-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KWT/indicators/WP11633.3?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used electronic payments (payments that one makes or that are made automatically including wire transfers or payments made online) in the past 12 months to make payments on bills or to buy things using money from their accounts (% female, age 15+)\nElectronic payments used to make payments, female (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:07:10.347Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:15:02.400Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:15:02.400Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":400015,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JOR_MYS_MEA_YSCH_7579_MA","name":"Jordan: mean years of schooling, 75-79, male","urlize_name":"Jordan-mean-years-of-schooling-75-79-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/JOR/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.7579.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 75-79, male is the mean years of schooling of the male population age 75-79.\nmean years of schooling, 75-79, male","created_at":"2012-01-07T05:06:12.547Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:12:44.362Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:12:44.362Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2126879,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZAF_EG_USE_COMM_FO_ZS","name":"South Africa: Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)","urlize_name":"South-Africa-Fossil-fuel-energy-consumption-of-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZAF/indicators/EG.USE.COMM.FO.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Fossil fuel comprises coal, oil, petroleum, and natural gas products.\nFossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:17:10.168Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:14:38.945Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:14:38.945Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6565609,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MKD_WP11629_2_5","name":"Macedonia, FYR: 1-2 withdrawals from account in a typical month, older adults (% with an account,  age 25+)","urlize_name":"Macedonia-FYR-1-2-withdrawals-from-account-in-a-typical-month-older-adults-with-an-account-age-25","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MKD/indicators/WP11629.2.5?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make 1-2 withdrawals from their personal account(s) in a typical month.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:23:22.967Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:43:20.895Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:43:20.895Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7777002,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_8ANTIGUAANDBARBUDA2542SUGARRAWEQUIVALENT","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Sugar (Raw Equivalent) - Antigua and Barbuda","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Sugar-Raw-Equivalent-Antigua-and-Barbuda","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:42:50.544Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:43:51.353Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:43:51.353Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7801288,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_199SLOVAKIA2592SUNFLOWERSEEDCAKE","name":"Commodity Balances Crops: Sunflowerseed Cake - Slovakia","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Crops-Sunflowerseed-Cake-Slovakia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:26:10.748Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:02.760Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:02.760Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Area (1000 Ha)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7685089,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_14BARBADOS521PEARS","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Pears - Barbados","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Pears-Barbados","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T08:28:45.142Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:07.450Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:07.450Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7684870,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_12BAHAMAS1924MEATBOVINEFRESHTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Meat Bovine Fresh + (Total) - Bahamas","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Meat-Bovine-Fresh-Total-Bahamas","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T15:26:39.554Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:03.652Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:44:03.652Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price (LCU/tonne) (LCU)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7817201,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_117REPUBLICOFKOREA1361AMMONIUMSULPHATE","name":"Resources Fertilizers Archive: Ammonium Sulphate - Republic of Korea","urlize_name":"Resources-Fertilizers-Archive-Ammonium-Sulphate-Republic-of-Korea","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_FertilizersArchive_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

Secondary is the number of female teachers at the secondary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the secondary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nSecondary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-09T13:06:51.237Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:51:49.526Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:51:49.526Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1992-12-31","to_date":"1995-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2098167,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TCD_DT_DIS_DPNG_CD","name":"Chad: Disbursements on external debt, private nonguaranteed (PNG) (DIS, current US$)","urlize_name":"Chad-Disbursements-on-external-debt-private-nonguaranteed-PNG-DIS-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TCD/indicators/DT.DIS.DPNG.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Private nonguaranteed external debt is an external obligation of a private debtor that is not guaranteed for repayment by a public entity.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-07T07:10:44.320Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:24:07.551Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:24:07.551Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":376123,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IDN_DC_DAC_NLDL_CD","name":"Indonesia: Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Netherlands (current US$)","urlize_name":"Indonesia-Net-bilateral-aid-flows-from-DAC-donors-Netherlands-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IDN/indicators/DC.DAC.NLDL.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC).

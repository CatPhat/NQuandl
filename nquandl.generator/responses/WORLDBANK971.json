Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:34:34.459Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:12:36.571Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:12:36.571Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6543763,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KHM_WP11645_6","name":"Cambodia: Saved any money in the past year, primary education or less (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Cambodia-Saved-any-money-in-the-past-year-primary-education-or-less-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KHM/indicators/WP11645.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved or set aside any money in the past 12 months (% with a primary education or less, age 15+)\nSaved any money in the past year, primary education or less (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-18T21:02:06.939Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:21:27.663Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:21:27.663Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":340542,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GIN_SN_ITK_SALT_ZS","name":"Guinea: Consumption of iodized salt (% of households)","urlize_name":"Guinea-Consumption-of-iodized-salt-of-households","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GIN/indicators/SN.ITK.SALT.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Consumption of iodized salt refers to the percentage of households that use edible salt fortified with iodine.\nConsumption of iodized salt (% of households)","created_at":"2012-01-05T22:05:16.591Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:54:17.447Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:54:17.447Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":207140,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEL_GC_TAX_IMPT_ZS","name":"Belgium: Customs and other import duties","urlize_name":"Belgium-Customs-and-other-import-duties","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEL/indicators/GC.TAX.IMPT.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Customs and other import duties are all levies collected on goods that are entering the country or services delivered by nonresidents to residents.

The calculation takes into account whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern as well as costs and the loss in value due to the time spent closing down. If the business keeps operating, no value is lost on the initial claim, set at 100 cents on the dollar. If it does not, the initial 100 cents on the dollar are reduced to 70 cents on the dollar. Then the official costs of the insolvency procedure are deducted (1 cent for each percentage of the initial value). Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is taken into account, including the loss of value due to depreciation of the hotel furniture. Consistent with international accounting practice, the depreciation rate for furniture is taken to be 20%. The furniture is assumed to account for a quarter of the total value of assets. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2006 lending rates from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics, supplemented with data from central banks.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

The ratio of PPP conversion factor to market exchange rate is the result obtained by dividing the PPP conversion factor by the market exchange rate. The ratio, also referred to as the national price level, makes it possible to compare the cost of the bundle of goods that make up gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States.\nPPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate ratio","created_at":"2012-01-09T21:19:40.127Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:09:27.687Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:09:27.687Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2067156,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DZA_WP11633_6","name":"Algeria: Electronic payments used to make payments, primary education or less (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Algeria-Electronic-payments-used-to-make-payments-primary-education-or-less-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DZA/indicators/WP11633.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used electronic payments (payments that one makes or that are made automatically including wire transfers or payments made online) in the past 12 months to make payments on bills or to buy things using money from their accounts (% with a primary education or less, age 15+)\nElectronic payments used to make payments, primary education or less (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T13:08:39.564Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:10:27.947Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:10:27.947Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2107729,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DZA_WP11668_10","name":"Algeria: Outstanding loan for home construction, rural (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Algeria-Outstanding-loan-for-home-construction-rural-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DZA/indicators/WP11668.10?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out to purchase materials or services to build, extend, or renovate their home or apartment (% living in an urban area, age 15+ )\nOutstanding loan for home construction, rural (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:40:33.986Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:01:14.984Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:01:14.984Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2129023,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TZA_SP_POP_1564_MA_IN","name":"Tanzania: Population ages 15-64, male","urlize_name":"Tanzania-Population-ages-15-64-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TZA/indicators/SP.POP.1564.MA.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Population ages 15-64, male\nPopulation ages 15-64, male","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:26:52.714Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:31:34.067Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:31:34.067Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6433473,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SRB_SI_POV_NAGP","name":"Serbia: Poverty gap at national poverty line (%)","urlize_name":"Serbia-Poverty-gap-at-national-poverty-line","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SRB/indicators/SI.POV.NAGP?per_page=1000","description":"World Bank, Global Poverty Working Group.

Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process. The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.

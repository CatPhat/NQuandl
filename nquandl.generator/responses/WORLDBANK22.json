ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\nNet bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, France (current US$)","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:41:36.641Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:47:13.111Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:47:13.111Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1964-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":371061,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HTI_BAR_SEC_SCHL_15UP","name":"Haiti: average years of secondary schooling, 15+, total","urlize_name":"Haiti-average-years-of-secondary-schooling-15-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HTI/indicators/BAR.SEC.SCHL.15UP?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of secondary schooling, 15+, total is the average years of secondary education completed among people over age 15. \naverage years of secondary schooling, 15+, total","created_at":"2012-01-06T13:37:45.319Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:47:03.160Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:47:03.160Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2146249,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UKR_MYS_POP_1519_NED_MF","name":"Ukraine: population in thousand, 15-19, total, no education","urlize_name":"Ukraine-population-in-thousand-15-19-total-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UKR/indicators/MYS.POP.1519.NED.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-19, total, no education is the total number of people age 15-19 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-19, total, no education","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:48:13.925Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:52:12.359Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:52:12.359Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":464630,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MAR_MYS_POP_7579_PRI_FE","name":"Morocco: population in thousand, 75-79, female, primary","urlize_name":"Morocco-population-in-thousand-75-79-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MAR/indicators/MYS.POP.7579.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 75-79, female, primary is the total number of females age 75-79 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 75-79, female, primary","created_at":"2012-01-10T05:56:44.539Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:52:14.464Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:52:14.464Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":405318,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KAZ_DT_DOD_DECT_CD_FF_JY","name":"Kazakhstan: 523_T2.1_Gross External Debt Foreign Currency and Foreign-Currency-Linked (FCFCL) (Yen)","urlize_name":"Kazakhstan-523_T2-1_Gross-External-Debt-Foreign-Currency-and-Foreign-Currency-Linked-FCFCL-Yen","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KAZ/indicators/DT.DOD.DECT.CD.FF.JY?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n523_T2.1_Gross External Debt Foreign Currency and Foreign-Currency-Linked (FCFCL) (Yen)","created_at":"2012-01-07T06:34:12.803Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T12:38:21.257Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T12:38:21.257Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-03-31","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":377629,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IND_BAR_PRM_SCHL_15UP_FE","name":"India: average years of primary schooling, 15+, female","urlize_name":"India-average-years-of-primary-schooling-15-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IND/indicators/BAR.PRM.SCHL.15UP.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of primary schooling, 15+, female is the average years of primary education completed among females over age 15. \naverage years of primary schooling, 15+, female","created_at":"2012-01-06T16:36:06.678Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:46:18.077Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:46:18.077Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2026480,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SOM_UIS_REPP_23_GPV_G6_M","name":"Somalia: Percentage of repeaters in secondary.

Primary. Never in school. Male is the percentage of male out-of-school primary-school-age children who have never attended school and are not likely to enter school in the future. Since no survey can say definitively that a school-age person will never attend school, this is a probabilistic indicator. The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

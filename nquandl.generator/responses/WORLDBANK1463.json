Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\nNet bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Netherlands (current US$)","created_at":"2012-08-08T16:55:08.745Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:29:40.297Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:29:40.297Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1972-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":317611,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EST_GC_TAX_INTT_RV_ZS","name":"Estonia: Taxes on international trade (% of revenue)","urlize_name":"Estonia-Taxes-on-international-trade-of-revenue","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EST/indicators/GC.TAX.INTT.RV.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Taxes on international trade include import duties, export duties, profits of export or import monopolies, exchange profits, and exchange taxes.\nTaxes on international trade (% of revenue)","created_at":"2012-01-05T10:27:56.212Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:00:38.047Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:00:38.047Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2004-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6469870,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TGO_MYS_POP_5054_PRI_MF","name":"Togo: population in thousand, 50-54, total, primary","urlize_name":"Togo-population-in-thousand-50-54-total-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TGO/indicators/MYS.POP.5054.PRI.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 50-54, total, primary is the total number of people age 50-54 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 50-54, total, primary","created_at":"2013-05-14T22:32:22.715Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:41:35.554Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:41:35.554Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":477288,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEX_MYS_PROP_6569_TER_MF","name":"Mexico: proportion, 65-69, total, tertiary","urlize_name":"Mexico-proportion-65-69-total-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MEX/indicators/MYS.PROP.6569.TER.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 65-69, total, tertiary is the proportion of the population age 65-69 with tertiary education.\nproportion, 65-69, total, tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-10T15:20:49.475Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:27:38.763Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:27:38.763Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":199981,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUS_MYS_PROP_7579_PRI_FE","name":"Australia: proportion, 75-79, female, primary","urlize_name":"Australia-proportion-75-79-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUS/indicators/MYS.PROP.7579.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 75-79, female, primary is the proportion of the female population age 75-79 with primary education.\nproportion, 75-79, female, primary","created_at":"2012-01-02T16:51:07.332Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:27:13.469Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:27:13.469Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":350440,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRC_SP_POP_AG05_MA_IN","name":"Greece: Age population, age 05, male, interpolated","urlize_name":"Greece-Age-population-age-05-male-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRC/indicators/SP.POP.AG05.MA.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, age 05, male, interpolated\nAge population, age 05, male, interpolated","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:27:09.772Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:04:56.623Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:04:56.623Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":274557,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COL_MYS_PROP_65UP_PRI_MF","name":"Colombia: proportion, 65+, total, primary","urlize_name":"Colombia-proportion-65-total-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COL/indicators/MYS.PROP.65UP.PRI.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 65+, total, primary is the proportion of the population over age 65 with primary education.\nproportion, 65+, total, primary","created_at":"2012-01-04T11:56:40.075Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:17:49.878Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:17:49.878Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":326329,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"FIN_MYS_PROP_3034_PRI_MF","name":"Finland: proportion, 30 -

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations includes the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA).

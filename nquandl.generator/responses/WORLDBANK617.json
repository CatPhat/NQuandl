Primary. Female is the total number of female pupils of the official primary school age group who are enrolled at primary or secondary education levels, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population. Net Enrollment Rate (NER) shows the coverage of pupils in the official primary school age group in the primary education level only while adjusted net enrollment rate (ANER) extents the measure to those of the official primary school age range who have reached secondary education because they might access primary education earlier than the official entrance age or skip grades due to their performance.\nTotal enrollment, primary, female (% net)","created_at":"2012-01-04T19:15:12.861Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:49:44.023Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"1994-12-31","to_date":"1997-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6463243,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BIH_ALLSI_BI_Q4","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina: (%) Benefits held by 4th 20% population - All Social Insurance","urlize_name":"Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Benefits-held-by-4th-20-population-All-Social-Insurance","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BIH/indicators/allsi.bi_q4?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the (%) Benefits held by 4th 20% population for All Social Insurance\n(%) Benefits held by 4th 20% population - All Social Insurance","created_at":"2013-05-14T19:35:58.669Z","updated_at":"2014-08-28T03:22:15.007Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-28T03:22:15.007Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":384561,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRL_MYS_MEA_YSCH_4564_FE","name":"Ireland: mean years of schooling, 45-64, female","urlize_name":"Ireland-mean-years-of-schooling-45-64-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRL/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.4564.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 45-64, female is the mean years of schooling of the female population age 45-64.\nmean years of schooling, 45-64, female","created_at":"2012-01-06T20:56:46.890Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:16.015Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:16.015Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6598883,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PHL_BAR_TER_SCHL_5559","name":"Philippines: average years of tertiary schooling, 55-59, total","urlize_name":"Philippines-average-years-of-tertiary-schooling-55-59-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PHL/indicators/BAR.TER.SCHL.5559?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of tertiary schooling, 55-59, total is the average years of tertiary education completed among people age 55-59. \naverage years of tertiary schooling, 55-59, total","created_at":"2013-05-21T12:12:42.794Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:05.906Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:05.906Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":322239,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"FIN_BAR_TER_CMPT_2529_ZS","name":"Finland: percentage of population (15+), 25-29, total, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"Finland-percentage-of-population-15-25-29-total-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/FIN/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.2529.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 25-29, total, completed tertiary is the percentage of people age 25-29 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 25-29, total, completed tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-05T12:34:23.605Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:17.055Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:16:17.055Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2171685,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"OMN_TM_TAX_MRCH_IP_ZS","name":"Oman: Share of tariff lines with international peaks, all products (%)","urlize_name":"Oman-Share-of-tariff-lines-with-international-peaks-all-products","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/OMN/indicators/TM.TAX.MRCH.IP.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Share of tariff lines with international peaks is the share of lines in the tariff schedule with tariff rates that exceed 15 percent.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

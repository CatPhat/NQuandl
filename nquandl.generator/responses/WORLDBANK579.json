Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process. The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Divisionâ€™s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mineâ€™s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.\nCO2 emissions from cement production (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:24:57.470Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:06:45.024Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:06:45.024Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2061711,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LVA_IC_FRM_INNOV_T3","name":"Latvia: Capacity utilization (%)","urlize_name":"Latvia-Capacity-utilization","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LVA/indicators/IC.FRM.INNOV.T3?per_page=1000","description":"Capacity utilization based on the comparison of the current output with the maximum output possible using all the resources available.

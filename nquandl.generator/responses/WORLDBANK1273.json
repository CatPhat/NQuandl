Total debt service (TDS) shows the debt service payments on total long-term debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of IMF credit, and interest on short-term debt only. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments in the year specified.  Exports of goods, services and income is the sum of goods (merchandise) exports, exports of (nonfactor) services and income (factor) receipts.  Data are in current U.S. dollars.  Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices. This item shows receipts by the reporting country. \nDebt service to export ratio, ex-post (%)","created_at":"2012-08-06T17:01:24.328Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:14.414Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:14.414Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6728523,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VEN_BAR_PRM_SCHL_7074_FE","name":"Venezuela, RB: average years of primary schooling, 70-74, female","urlize_name":"Venezuela-RB-average-years-of-primary-schooling-70-74-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/VEN/indicators/BAR.PRM.SCHL.7074.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of primary schooling, 70-74, female is the average years of primary education completed among females age 70-74. \naverage years of primary schooling, 70-74, female","created_at":"2013-05-24T16:49:56.223Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:34:25.798Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:34:25.798Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6506665,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CZE_GFDD_OI_12","name":"Czech Republic: Consolidated foreign claims of BIS-reporting banks to GDP (%)","urlize_name":"Czech-Republic-Consolidated-foreign-claims-of-BIS-reporting-banks-to-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CZE/indicators/GFDD.OI.12?per_page=1000","description":"The ratio of consolidated foreign claims to GDP of the banks that are reporting to BIS.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T13:50:26.442Z","updated_at":"2014-01-13T22:50:46.395Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-13T22:50:46.395Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1987-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7798547,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_58ECUADOR2662JUTE","name":"Commodity Balances Crops: Jute - Ecuador","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Crops-Jute-Ecuador","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form.

The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.

The index ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing better performance. Data are from Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. 2009 round of surveys covered more than 5,000 country assessments by nearly 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis.

Details of the survey methodology are in Arvis and others' Connecting to Compete 2010: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy (2010). Respondents assessed the ease of arranging competitively priced shipments to markets, on a rating ranging from 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy).

The time calculation for a procedure starts from the moment it is initiated and runs until it is completed. If a procedure can be accelerated for an additional cost, the fastest legal procedure is chosen. It is assumed that neither the exporter nor the importer wastes time and that each commits to completing each remaining procedure without delay. Procedures that can be completed in parallel are measured as simultaneous. The waiting time between procedures--for example, during unloading of the cargo--is included in the measure.\nTime to export (days)","created_at":"2012-01-06T03:02:17.062Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:37.859Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:37.859Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":198248,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_AG_LND_FRST_ZS","name":"Austria: Forest area (% of land area)","urlize_name":"Austria-Forest-area-of-land-area","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUT/indicators/AG.LND.FRST.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees of at least 5 meters in situ, whether productive or not, and excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems (for example, in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) and trees in urban parks and gardens.\nForest area (% of land area)","created_at":"2012-01-02T15:42:29.154Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.451Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.451Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":527188,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NER_AG_LND_AGRI_ZS","name":"Niger: Agricultural land (% of land area)","urlize_name":"Niger-Agricultural-land-of-land-area","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NER/indicators/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Agricultural land refers to the share of land area that is arable, under permanent crops, and under permanent pastures.

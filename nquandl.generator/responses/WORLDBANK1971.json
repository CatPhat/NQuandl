Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the import volume indexes (lines 73) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nImport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:18:00.665Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:56:55.319Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:56:55.319Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":335725,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_DP_DOD_DSCD_CR_GG_CD","name":"Georgia: 003.Currency and deposits (PSDGG, ST) US$","urlize_name":"Georgia-003-Currency-and-deposits-PSDGG-ST-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/DP.DOD.DSCD.CR.GG.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n003.Currency and deposits (PSDGG, ST) US$","created_at":"2012-01-05T19:49:34.936Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:56:55.346Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:56:55.346Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-09-30","to_date":"2014-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6538912,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_DB_MAX_HR_DAY","name":"Kenya: Maximum working days per week","urlize_name":"Kenya-Maximum-working-days-per-week","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/db_max_hr_day?per_page=1000","description":"Maximum working days per week\nMaximum working days per week","created_at":"2013-05-18T17:17:18.647Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:56:55.429Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:56:55.429Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":212279,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BFA_DT_DOD_RSDL_CD","name":"Burkina Faso: Residual, debt stock-flow reconciliation (current US$)","urlize_name":"Burkina-Faso-Residual-debt-stock-flow-reconciliation-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BFA/indicators/DT.DOD.RSDL.CD?per_page=1000","description":"The residual difference, i.e. the change in stock not explained by any of the factors identified under debt stock-flow reconciliation, is calculated as the sum of identified accounts minus the change in stock.

GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2013-01-16T13:58:55.525Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:57:05.333Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:57:05.333Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1962-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6490803,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_NV_SRV_TETC_CD","name":"Uganda: Services, etc., value added (current US$)","urlize_name":"Uganda-Services-etc-value-added-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/NV.SRV.TETC.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Services correspond to ISIC divisions 50-99.

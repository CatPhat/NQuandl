On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:50:26.722Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:02:47.480Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:02:47.480Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7853852,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_171PHILIPPINES1655SEMICHEMICALWOODPULP","name":"Forestry: Semi-Chemical Wood Pulp - Philippines","urlize_name":"Forestry-Semi-Chemical-Wood-Pulp-Philippines","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2012-08-07T20:08:25.787Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:07:08.403Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:07:08.403Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":514813,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MOZ_BX_TRF_MGR_DT_GD_ZS","name":"Mozambique: Migrant remittance inflows (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Mozambique-Migrant-remittance-inflows-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MOZ/indicators/BX.TRF.MGR.DT.GD.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Migrants’ remittances are defined as the sum of worker’s remittances,\nMigrant remittance inflows (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:31:20.928Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:30:16.318Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:30:16.318Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":374859,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HUN_MYS_POP_3034_PRI_MA","name":"Hungary: population in thousand, 30 - 34, male, primary","urlize_name":"Hungary-population-in-thousand-30-34-male-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HUN/indicators/MYS.POP.3034.PRI.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 30-34, male, primary is the total number of males age 30-34 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 30 - 34, male, primary","created_at":"2012-01-06T15:22:34.132Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:25:15.026Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:25:15.026Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6475223,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BRA_SA_SP_INC_P1","name":"Brazil: Poverty Gap reduction (%) - Social Pension","urlize_name":"Brazil-Poverty-Gap-reduction-Social-Pension","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BRA/indicators/sa_sp.inc_p1?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Poverty Gap reduction (%) for Social Pension \nPoverty Gap reduction (%) - Social Pension ","created_at":"2013-05-15T02:14:54.897Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T21:59:41.597Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T21:59:41.597Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":415746,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KHM_EN_CO2_TRAN_MT","name":"Cambodia: CO2 emissions from transport (million metric tons)","urlize_name":"Cambodia-CO2-emissions-from-transport-million-metric-tons","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KHM/indicators/EN.CO2.TRAN.MT?per_page=1000","description":"CO2 emissions from transport contains emissions from the combustion of fuel for all transport activity, regardless of the sector, except for international marine bunkers and international aviation.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:46:56.127Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:57:08.760Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:57:08.760Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":308861,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_GER_PRI_POP_ATTN_3539_MA","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Population by educational attainment, primary, male","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Population-by-educational-attainment-primary-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/GER.PRI.POP.ATTN.3539.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 35-39) is the total number of males age 35-39 with primary education.\nPopulation by educational attainment, primary, male (aged 35-39)","created_at":"2012-01-05T06:24:34.087Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:51:51.582Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2121747,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"URY_MYS_PROP_65UP_SEC_FE","name":"Uruguay: proportion, 65+, female, secondary","urlize_name":"Uruguay-proportion-65-female-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/URY/indicators/MYS.PROP.65UP.SEC.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 65+, female, secondary is the proportion of the female population over age 65 with secondary education.\nproportion, 65+, female, secondary","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:51:46.828Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:38:48.498Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:38:48.498Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":515579,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MUS_SH_HIV_PREG_VIRALS_NUM","name":"Mauritius: Number of HIV positive pregnant women receiving antiretrovirals","urlize_name":"Mauritius-Number-of-HIV-positive-pregnant-women-receiving-antiretrovirals","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MUS/indicators/SH.HIV.PREG.VIRALS.NUM?per_page=1000","description":"Number of HIV-infected pregnant women who received antiretrovirals during the last 12 months to reduce mother-to-child transmission.

This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of female literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100. \nLiteracy rate, adult female (% of females ages 15 and above)","created_at":"2012-08-09T09:15:36.199Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:11.385Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:11.385Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1976-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":270198,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COM_SH_TBS_INCD_LW","name":"Comoros: Incidence of tuberculosis, low uncertainty bound (per 100,000 people)","urlize_name":"Comoros-Incidence-of-tuberculosis-low-uncertainty-bound-per-100-000-people","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COM/indicators/SH.TBS.INCD.LW?per_page=1000","description":"Incidence of tuberculosis is the estimated number of new pulmonary, smear positive, and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases.\nIncidence of tuberculosis, low uncertainty bound (per 100,000 people)","created_at":"2012-01-04T09:51:53.096Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:29.918Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:29.918Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6478475,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TKM_WP11651_9","name":"Turkmenistan: Loan from a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Turkmenistan-Loan-from-a-financial-institution-in-the-past-year-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TKM/indicators/WP11651.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a bank, credit union or another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives) or microfinance institution (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nLoan from a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-15T02:51:17.404Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:43:49.041Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:43:49.041Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2171630,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JOR_WP11631_1_4","name":"Jordan: ATM is main mode of deposit into account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","urlize_name":"Jordan-ATM-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-young-adults-with-an-account-age-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/JOR/indicators/WP11631.1.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is an ATM (% ages 15-24, with a formal account)\nATM is main mode of deposit into account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","created_at":"2012-08-09T01:47:35.004Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:49:50.721Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:49:50.721Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6491702,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_SP_POP_AG04_FE_IN","name":"Uganda: Age population, age 04, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Uganda-Age-population-age-04-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/SP.POP.AG04.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, age 04, female, interpolated\nAge population, age 04, female, interpolated","created_at":"2013-05-15T12:27:24.646Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:26:16.629Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:26:16.629Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6502387,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VUT_UIS_LR_AG15T99_GPI","name":"Vanuatu: Gender parity index for adult literacy rate","urlize_name":"Vanuatu-Gender-parity-index-for-adult-literacy-rate","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/VUT/indicators/UIS.LR.AG15T99.GPI?per_page=1000","description":"Gender parity index for adult literacy rate is the ratio of female adult literacy rate to the male adult literacy rate.

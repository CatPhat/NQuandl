Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region.

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-07T17:55:38.420Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:52:31.833Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:52:31.833Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":262972,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CIV_NY_GDP_NGAS_RT_ZS","name":"Cote d'Ivoire: Natural gas rents (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Cote-d-Ivoire-Natural-gas-rents-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CIV/indicators/NY.GDP.NGAS.RT.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Natural gas rents are the difference between the value of natural gas production at world prices and total costs of production.\nNatural gas rents (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-04T07:18:39.993Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:14:23.328Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:14:23.328Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":216809,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BFA_MYS_PROP_7579_PRI_FE","name":"Burkina Faso: proportion, 75-79, female, primary","urlize_name":"Burkina-Faso-proportion-75-79-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BFA/indicators/MYS.PROP.7579.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 75-79, female, primary is the proportion of the female population age 75-79 with primary education.\nproportion, 75-79, female, primary","created_at":"2012-01-02T23:18:05.683Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:35:27.021Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:35:27.021Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":378755,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IDN_MYS_POP_25UP_SEC_FE","name":"Indonesia: population in thousand, 25+, female, secondary","urlize_name":"Indonesia-population-in-thousand-25-female-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IDN/indicators/MYS.POP.25UP.SEC.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 25+, female, secondary is the total number of females over age 25 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 25+, female, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T17:19:17.104Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:13:47.337Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:13:47.337Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":212959,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BFA_DT_ODA_DACD_SNGO_CD","name":"Burkina Faso: Gross ODA aid disbursement for support to non-governmental organizations, DAC donors total","urlize_name":"Burkina-Faso-Gross-ODA-aid-disbursement-for-support-to-non-governmental-organizations-DAC-donors-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BFA/indicators/DT.ODA.DACD.SNGO.CD?per_page=1000","description":"\nGross ODA aid disbursement for support to non-governmental organizations, DAC donors total (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-02T22:02:41.935Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:42:17.565Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2002-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2183173,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ROU_ALLSP_BI_Q3","name":"Romania: (%) Benefits held by 3rd 20% population - All Social Protection","urlize_name":"Romania-Benefits-held-by-3rd-20-population-All-Social-Protection","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ROU/indicators/allsp.bi_q3?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the (%) Benefits held by 3rd 20% population for All Social Protection\n(%) Benefits held by 3rd 20% population - All Social Protection","created_at":"2012-08-09T02:57:33.609Z","updated_at":"2014-08-26T19:59:37.685Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-26T19:59:37.685Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2242139,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"STP_MO_INDEX_SRLW_XQ","name":"Sao Tome and Principe: Safety and Rule of Law","urlize_name":"Sao-Tome-and-Principe-Safety-and-Rule-of-Law","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/STP/indicators/MO.INDEX.SRLW.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"Personal Safety:  Within this sub-category the Ibrahim Index measures: (i) Safety of the Person – level of criminality in a country.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs. Regional estimates of the Boone indicator pool the bank data by regions (for more information, see Hay and Liu 1997; Boone 2001; Boone, Griffith, and Harrison 2005).

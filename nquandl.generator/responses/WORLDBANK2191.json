After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

Secondary is the enrolment in private secondary schools expressed as a percentage of total enrolment (public and private) in secondary schools. 'Private' refers to all educational institutions not operated by a public authority, regardless of whether they receive financial support from public authorities. A high percentage indicates strong involvement of the non-governmental sector (including religious bodies, other organizations, associations, communities, private enterprises or persons) in providing organized educational programmes.\nSchool enrollment, secondary, private (% of total secondary)","created_at":"2012-01-10T05:55:10.113Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:36:15.807Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:36:15.807Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2160427,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NOC_WP11652_9","name":"High income: nonOECD: Loan through store credit in the past year, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"High-income-nonOECD-Loan-through-store-credit-in-the-past-year-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NOC/indicators/WP11652.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a store by using installment credit or buying on credit (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nLoan through store credit in the past year, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T00:27:25.199Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:36:14.462Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:36:14.462Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":355748,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GUM_VA_EST","name":"Guam: Voice and Accountability: Estimate","urlize_name":"Guam-Voice-and-Accountability-Estimate","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GUM/indicators/VA.EST?per_page=1000","description":"Voice and Accountability captures perceptions of the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media.\nVoice and Accountability: Estimate","created_at":"2012-01-06T05:40:35.770Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:06:19.487Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:06:19.487Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2121951,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MCO_UIS_E_1_AGI1","name":"Monaco: Pupils of the official school age.

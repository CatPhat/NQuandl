official flows from UN agencies are the net disbursements of total official flows from the UN agencies. Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (current LCU)","created_at":"2012-01-06T01:30:40.062Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:03:26.946Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:03:26.946Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1988-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6583302,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NLD_WP11634_9","name":"Netherlands: Account used to receive wages, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Netherlands-Account-used-to-receive-wages-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NLD/indicators/WP11634.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a formal account in the past 12 months to receive money or payments for work or from selling goods (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nAccount used to receive wages, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-21T02:46:34.376Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:02:20.694Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:02:20.694Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6433068,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ATG_UIS_ROFST_2_F","name":"Antigua and Barbuda: Out-of-school rate for children of lower secondary school age (%).

Accordingly, the coverage of portfolio investment differs in these regards from the coverage of bank claims, which include indistinguishably export credit lending by banks. The bank claims data represent the net change in banks’ claims after adjustment to eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates. They are therefore a proxy for net flow data, but are not themselves a net flow figure. They differ in two further regards from other OECD data.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2012-08-06T19:11:35.496Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:01:59.355Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:01:59.355Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":508429,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MNG_BAR_POP_1519_FE","name":"Mongolia: population in thousands (age 15+), 15-19, female","urlize_name":"Mongolia-population-in-thousands-age-15-15-19-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MNG/indicators/BAR.POP.1519.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousands, 15-19, female is the female population of 15-19 year olds in thousands estimated by Barro-Lee.\npopulation in thousands (age 15+), 15-19, female","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:26:37.496Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:54:29.327Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:54:29.327Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":328150,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"FRA_MYS_POP_4564_NED_MF","name":"France: population in thousand, 45-64, total, no education","urlize_name":"France-population-in-thousand-45-64-total-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/FRA/indicators/MYS.POP.4564.NED.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 45-64, total, no education is the total number of people age 45-64 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 45-64, total, no education","created_at":"2012-01-05T15:40:30.059Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:14:05.885Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:14:05.885Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6433976,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SRB_UIS_REPP_1_G1","name":"Serbia: Percentage of repeaters in primary.

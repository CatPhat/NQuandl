Definitions for each indicator follow.  Total debt service (TDS) shows the debt service payments on total long-term debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of IMF credit, and interest on short-term debt only. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments in the year specified.  Exports of goods, services and income is the sum of goods (merchandise) exports, exports of (nonfactor) services and income (factor) receipts.  Data are in current U.S. dollars.  Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices.

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2013-05-20T15:10:03.044Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T10:36:34.472Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T10:36:34.472Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1968-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":394457,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ITA_MYS_PROP_2024_NED_MF","name":"Italy: proportion, 20 - 24, total, no education","urlize_name":"Italy-proportion-20-24-total-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ITA/indicators/MYS.PROP.2024.NED.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 20-24, total, no education is the proportion of the population age 20-24 with no education.\nproportion, 20 - 24, total, no education","created_at":"2012-01-07T01:52:18.369Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:30:29.075Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:30:29.075Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":322158,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ETH_MYS_MEA_YSCH_2024_FE","name":"Ethiopia: mean years of schooling, 20 - 24, female","urlize_name":"Ethiopia-mean-years-of-schooling-20-24-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ETH/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.2024.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 20 - 24, female is the mean years of schooling of the female population age 20-24.\nmean years of schooling, 20 - 24, female","created_at":"2012-01-05T12:32:41.310Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:48:31.281Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:48:31.281Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2241314,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDV_UIS_NERT_1_GPI","name":"Maldives: Gender parity index for adjusted net enrolment rate.

Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

Female is the percentage of females age 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. Generally, ‘literacy’ also encompasses ‘numeracy’, the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of female literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100. \nLiteracy rate, adult female (% of females ages 15 and above)","created_at":"2012-01-04T05:34:20.164Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:46:18.539Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:46:18.539Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1982-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":520299,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NAM_SP_POP_AG21_FE_IN","name":"Namibia: Age population, age 21, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Namibia-Age-population-age-21-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NAM/indicators/SP.POP.AG21.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 21, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-03-05T11:21:40.913Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:45:16.173Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:45:16.173Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2140214,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"URY_SP_POP_AG19_FE_IN","name":"Uruguay: Age population, age 19, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Uruguay-Age-population-age-19-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/URY/indicators/SP.POP.AG19.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 19, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:21:50.246Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:08:35.977Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:08:35.977Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":200949,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BDI_SH_HIV_PREG_VIRALS_ZS","name":"Burundi: HIV positive pregnant women receiving antiretrovirals, using WHO/UNAIDS methodology (%)","urlize_name":"Burundi-HIV-positive-pregnant-women-receiving-antiretrovirals-using-WHO-UNAIDS-methodology","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BDI/indicators/SH.HIV.PREG.VIRALS.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of HIV-infected pregnant women who received antiretrovirals to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes.

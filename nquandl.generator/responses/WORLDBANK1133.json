dioxide emissions from cement production refer mainly to emissions during cement production. Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process. The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.\nCO2 emissions from cement production (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:34:22.798Z","updated_at":"2014-11-23T01:42:39.516Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-23T01:42:39.516Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":367661,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HND_MYS_PROP_15UP_TER_MA","name":"Honduras: proportion, 15+, male, tertiary","urlize_name":"Honduras-proportion-15-male-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HND/indicators/MYS.PROP.15UP.TER.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 15+, male, tertiary is the proportion of the male population over age 15 with tertiary education.\nproportion, 15+, male, tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:21:06.284Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:07:42.938Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:07:42.938Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2124992,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KWT_WP11671_2","name":"Kuwait: Outstanding loan for funerals or weddings, male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Kuwait-Outstanding-loan-for-funerals-or-weddings-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KWT/indicators/WP11671.2?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out for funerals or weddings (% male, age 15+)\nOutstanding loan for funerals or weddings, male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:08:04.595Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:38:07.051Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:38:07.051Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":461817,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MAR_TM_QTY_MRCH_XD_WB","name":"Morocco: Merchandise import volume index","urlize_name":"Morocco-Merchandise-import-volume-index","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MAR/indicators/TM.QTY.MRCH.XD.WB?per_page=1000","description":"Total merchandise imports  volume index with 1987=100. \nMerchandise import volume index","created_at":"2012-01-10T02:48:26.383Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:41:40.076Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:41:40.076Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":529166,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NAM_MYS_POP_1564_SEC_MA","name":"Namibia: population in thousand, 15-64, male, secondary","urlize_name":"Namibia-population-in-thousand-15-64-male-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NAM/indicators/MYS.POP.1564.SEC.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-64, male, secondary is the total number of males age 15-64 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-64, male, secondary","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:57:25.623Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:52:35.359Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:52:35.359Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6485687,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CAF_UIS_E_23_GPV_G7","name":"Central African Republic: Enrolment in secondary.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

Inflows into emerging countries’ stocks markets, are, however, heavily understated. Accordingly, the coverage of portfolio investment differs in these regards from the coverage of bank claims, which include indistinguishably export credit lending by banks. The bank claims data represent the net change in banks’ claims after adjustment to eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates. They are therefore a proxy for net flow data, but are not themselves a net flow figure. They differ in two further regards from other OECD data. First, they relate to loans by banks resident in countries which report quarterly to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Secondly, no adjustment has been made to exclude short-term claims.

A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nGINI index","created_at":"2012-01-02T23:09:58.753Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:08.350Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:08.350Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1989-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2176078,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ROU_DMGSRMRCHSACD","name":"Romania: Imports Merchandise, Customs, current US$, millions, seas. adj.","urlize_name":"Romania-Imports-Merchandise-Customs-current-US-millions-seas-adj","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ROU/indicators/DMGSRMRCHSACD?per_page=1000","description":"Merchandise (goods) imports, cost, insurance and freight basis (c.i.f.), in current US$ millions, seasonally adjusted.\nImports Merchandise, Customs, current US$, millions, seas. adj.","created_at":"2012-08-09T02:14:33.966Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:00.794Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:00.794Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6449508,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SWE_IC_WRH_PROC","name":"Sweden: Procedures to build a warehouse (number)","urlize_name":"Sweden-Procedures-to-build-a-warehouse-number","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SWE/indicators/IC.WRH.PROC?per_page=1000","description":"Number of procedures to build a warehouse is the number of interactions of a company's employees or managers with external parties, including government agency staff, public inspectors, notaries, land registry and cadastre staff, and technical experts apart from architects and engineers.\nProcedures to build a warehouse (number)","created_at":"2013-05-14T13:47:29.074Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:08.307Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:08.307Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6491390,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_SI_POV_5DAY","name":"Uganda: Poverty headcount ratio at $5 a day (PPP) (% of population)","urlize_name":"Uganda-Poverty-headcount-ratio-at-5-a-day-PPP-of-population","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/SI.POV.5DAY?per_page=1000","description":"Population below $5 a day is the percentage of the population living on less than $5 a day at 2005 international prices. \nPoverty headcount ratio at $5 a day (PPP) (% of population)","created_at":"2013-05-15T12:19:56.563Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:10.291Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:10:10.291Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1989-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":521856,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MOZ_IC_IMP_DOCS","name":"Mozambique: Documents to import (number)","urlize_name":"Mozambique-Documents-to-import-number","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MOZ/indicators/IC.IMP.DOCS?per_page=1000","description":"All documents required per shipment to import goods are recorded.

The index ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing better performance. Data are from Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. 2009 round of surveys covered more than 5,000 country assessments by nearly 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis.

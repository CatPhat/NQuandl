The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:18:06.280Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:41:43.332Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:41:43.332Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)","Import Quantity (Kg)","Export Quantity (Kg)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7779088,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_169PARAGUAY2601TOMATOES","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Tomatoes - Paraguay","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Tomatoes-Paraguay","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T18:58:14.269Z","updated_at":"2014-01-13T09:55:24.556Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-13T09:55:24.556Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7635721,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_58ECUADOR560GRAPES","name":"Prices Indices: Grapes - Ecuador","urlize_name":"Prices-Indices-Grapes-Ecuador","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Price_Indices_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:34:12.684Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T21:19:23.313Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-24T21:19:23.313Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7660971,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_160NIUE1055INDIGENOUSPIGMEAT","name":"Value of Production: Indigenous Pigmeat - Niue","urlize_name":"Value-of-Production-Indigenous-Pigmeat-Niue","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Value_of_Production_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:01:00.061Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:54:54.021Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:54:54.021Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Non-fertilizer use (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7762614,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5803SMALLISLANDDEVELOPINGSTATESTOTAL466JUICEOFVEGETABLESNES","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Juice of Vegetables Nes - Small Island Developing States + (Total)","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Juice-of-Vegetables-Nes-Small-Island-Developing-States-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T10:00:01.991Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T22:30:09.932Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T22:30:09.932Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7739831,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_70FRENCHPOLYNESIA841CMPDFEEDPOULTRY","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cmpd Feed,Poultry - French Polynesia","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cmpd-Feed-Poultry-French-Polynesia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T18:31:20.466Z","updated_at":"2014-01-10T12:45:05.446Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-10T12:45:05.446Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7687800,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_48COSTARICA127TAPIOCAOFCASSAVA","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Tapioca of Cassava - Costa Rica","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Tapioca-of-Cassava-Costa-Rica","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

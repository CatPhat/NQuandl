GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-02T20:11:56.916Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.086Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.086Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1962-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":216853,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BGR_SP_POP_0713_TO_UN","name":"Bulgaria: Population, aged 7-13, total","urlize_name":"Bulgaria-Population-aged-7-13-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BGR/indicators/SP.POP.0713.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 7-13, total is the total population age 7-13.\nPopulation, aged 7-13, total","created_at":"2012-01-02T23:18:41.322Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.141Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.141Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6500891,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VNM_SL_TLF_ACTI_MA_ZS","name":"Vietnam: Labor force participation rate, male (% of male population ages 15-64)","urlize_name":"Vietnam-Labor-force-participation-rate-male-of-male-population-ages-15-64","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/VNM/indicators/SL.TLF.ACTI.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Labor force participation rate, male (% of male population ages 15-64)\nLabor force participation rate, male (% of male population ages 15-64)","created_at":"2013-05-15T22:50:54.959Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.184Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.184Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2145792,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZWE_SP_POP_1218_TO_UN","name":"Zimbabwe: Population, aged 12-18, total","urlize_name":"Zimbabwe-Population-aged-12-18-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZWE/indicators/SP.POP.1218.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12-18, total is the total population age 12-18.\nPopulation, aged 12-18, total","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:46:28.495Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.369Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:07:27.369Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6592461,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PER_BX_GSR_TRAN_ZS","name":"Peru: Transport services (% of service exports, BoP)","urlize_name":"Peru-Transport-services-of-service-exports-BoP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PER/indicators/BX.GSR.TRAN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Transport covers all transport services (sea, air, land, internal waterway, pipeline, space and electricity transmission) performed by residents of one economy for those of another and involving the carriage of passengers, the movement of goods (freight), rental of carriers with crew, and related support and auxiliary services.

For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961. These estimates are provided by countries through an annual survey conducted by FAO Forestry Department in partnership with the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources. Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T05:18:46.704Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:52:23.741Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:52:23.741Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2003-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7706268,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_131MALAYSIA57GERMOFMAIZE","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Germ of Maize - Malaysia","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Germ-of-Maize-Malaysia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T13:31:10.841Z","updated_at":"2014-01-10T02:25:19.267Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-10T02:25:19.267Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Feed (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7733976,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_185RUSSIANFEDERATION907PROCESSEDCHEESE","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Processed Cheese - Russian Federation","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Processed-Cheese-Russian-Federation","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

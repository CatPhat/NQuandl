Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and \"work in progress.\" According to the 1993 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation.\nGross capital formation (annual % growth)","created_at":"2012-01-04T12:01:20.272Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.386Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.386Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":294811,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DZA_SP_POP_1018_TO_UN","name":"Algeria: Population, aged 10-18, total","urlize_name":"Algeria-Population-aged-10-18-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DZA/indicators/SP.POP.1018.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 10-18, total is the total population age 10-18.\nPopulation, aged 10-18, total","created_at":"2012-01-04T22:26:49.870Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.382Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.382Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":512501,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MRT_SP_POP_1018_TO_UN","name":"Mauritania: Population, aged 10-18, total","urlize_name":"Mauritania-Population-aged-10-18-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MRT/indicators/SP.POP.1018.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 10-18, total is the total population age 10-18.\nPopulation, aged 10-18, total","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:12:34.290Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.610Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.610Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":426062,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LAO_SP_POP_0612_FE_UN","name":"Lao PDR: Population, aged 6-12, female","urlize_name":"Lao-PDR-Population-aged-6-12-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LAO/indicators/SP.POP.0612.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 6-12, female is the total number of females age 6-12.\nPopulation, aged 6-12, female","created_at":"2012-01-07T15:45:28.596Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.534Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:33:09.534Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2094148,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TCD_TM_VAL_MRCH_AL_ZS","name":"Chad: Merchandise imports from economies in the Arab World (% of total merchandise imports)","urlize_name":"Chad-Merchandise-imports-from-economies-in-the-Arab-World-of-total-merchandise-imports","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TCD/indicators/TM.VAL.MRCH.AL.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Merchandise imports from economies in the Arab World are the sum of merchandise imports by the reporting economy from economies in the Arab World.

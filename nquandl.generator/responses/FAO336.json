The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:54:42.360Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:16:12.268Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:16:12.268Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7680291,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_202SOUTHAFRICA580PINEAPPLEJUICECONC","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Pineapple Juice Conc - South Africa","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Pineapple-Juice-Conc-South-Africa","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

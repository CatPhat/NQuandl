A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2013-01-16T18:07:20.303Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T09:07:25.512Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T09:07:25.512Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":506217,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MNE_SH_XPD_OOPC_ZS","name":"Montenegro: Out-of-pocket health expenditure (% of private expenditure on health)","urlize_name":"Montenegro-Out-of-pocket-health-expenditure-of-private-expenditure-on-health","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MNE/indicators/SH.XPD.OOPC.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"World Health Organization National Health Account database (see http://apps.who.int/nha/database/DataExplorerRegime.aspx for the most recent updates).\nOut-of-pocket health expenditure (% of private expenditure on health)","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:01:43.181Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:36:03.883Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:36:03.883Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":211756,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEN_EN_ATM_CO2E_FF_KT","name":"Benin: CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","urlize_name":"Benin-CO2-emissions-from-fossil-fuels-total-thousand-metric-tons","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEN/indicators/EN.ATM.CO2E.FF.KT?per_page=1000","description":"Fossil fuel is any hydrocarbon deposit that can be burned for heat or power, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas. This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-02T21:38:26.518Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:05:24.681Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:05:24.681Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6462782,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SYR_UIS_E_2","name":"Syrian Arab Republic: Enrolment in lower secondary.

The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger.

The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\nNet bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, European Union institutions (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:37:40.223Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:36:43.133Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:36:43.133Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2106028,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BOL_SA_SP_CDG_CI","name":"Bolivia: Concentration index - Social Pension","urlize_name":"Bolivia-Concentration-index-Social-Pension","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BOL/indicators/sa_sp.cdg_ci?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Concentration index for Social Pension\nConcentration index - Social Pension","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:31:56.374Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T10:31:42.672Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T10:31:42.672Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":314477,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ERI_IT_NET_CONN_CN","name":"Eritrea: Fixed broadband Internet connection charge (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Eritrea-Fixed-broadband-Internet-connection-charge-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ERI/indicators/IT.NET.CONN.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Fixed (Wired) broadband Internet connection charge is the initial, one-time charge for a new fixed (wired)  broadband Internet connection.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

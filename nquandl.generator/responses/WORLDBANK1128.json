For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education.

Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:08:18.443Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:56:59.976Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:56:59.976Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":202276,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_MYS_POP_7074_TER_FE","name":"Austria: population in thousand, 70-74, female, tertiary","urlize_name":"Austria-population-in-thousand-70-74-female-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUT/indicators/MYS.POP.7074.TER.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 70-74, female, tertiary is the total number of females age 70-74 (in thousands) with tertiary education.\npopulation in thousand, 70-74, female, tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-02T17:42:20.996Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:52:01.384Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:52:01.384Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2167827,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NER_MYS_MEA_YSCH_80UP_FE","name":"Niger: mean years of schooling, 80+, female","urlize_name":"Niger-mean-years-of-schooling-80-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NER/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.80UP.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 80+, female is the mean years of schooling of the female population over age 80.\nmean years of schooling, 80+, female","created_at":"2012-08-09T01:21:30.858Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:17.210Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:17.210Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":194605,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARM_MYS_PROP_1519_PRI_MF","name":"Armenia: proportion, 15-19, total, primary","urlize_name":"Armenia-proportion-15-19-total-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARM/indicators/MYS.PROP.1519.PRI.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 15-19, total, primary is the proportion of the population age 15-19 with primary education.\nproportion, 15-19, total, primary","created_at":"2012-01-02T13:40:20.286Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:26.874Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:25:26.874Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2073691,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"YEM_HH_MICS_NAR_1_Q1","name":"Yemen, Rep.: MICS: Net attendance rate.

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

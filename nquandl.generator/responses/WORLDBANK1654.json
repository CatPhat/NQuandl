Tariff line data were matched to Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) revision 3 codes to define commodity groups and import weights. To the extent possible, specific rates have been converted to their ad valorem equivalent rates and have been included in the calculation of weighted mean tariffs. Import weights were calculated using the United Nations Statistics Division's Commodity Trade (Comtrade) database. Effectively applied tariff rates at the six- and eight-digit product level are averaged for products in each commodity group. When the effectively applied rate is unavailable, the most favored nation rate is used instead. Primary products are commodities classified in SITC revision 3 sections 0-4 plus division 68 (nonferrous metals).\nTariff rate, applied, weighted mean, primary products (%)","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:05:01.077Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T18:06:34.058Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T18:06:34.058Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6443380,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVN_IC_FRM_REG_BUS5","name":"Slovenia: Percent of firms identifying business licensing and permits as a major constraint","urlize_name":"Slovenia-Percent-of-firms-identifying-business-licensing-and-permits-as-a-major-constraint","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVN/indicators/IC.FRM.REG.BUS5?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms identifying business licensing and permits as a major constraint.

Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\nNet bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Australia (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-02T10:51:01.798Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:39:58.281Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"1965-12-31","to_date":"2004-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6545377,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KSV_DT_DOD_PUOO_ST_CD","name":"Kosovo: 176_T4_Public Sector, Other Liabilities, Other (ST)","urlize_name":"Kosovo-176_T4_Public-Sector-Other-Liabilities-Other-ST","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KSV/indicators/DT.DOD.PUOO.ST.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n176_T4_Public Sector, Other Liabilities, Other (ST)","created_at":"2013-05-18T23:44:27.378Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T11:25:11.173Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T11:25:11.173Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-03-31","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":241758,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BRN_NE_GDI_STKB_KN","name":"Brunei Darussalam: Changes in inventories (constant LCU)","urlize_name":"Brunei-Darussalam-Changes-in-inventories-constant-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BRN/indicators/NE.GDI.STKB.KN?per_page=1000","description":"Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and \"work in progress.\" Data are in constant local currency.\nChanges in inventories (constant LCU)","created_at":"2012-01-03T22:13:59.263Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:35:48.621Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:35:48.621Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":205903,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AZE_IS_VEH_NVEH_P3","name":"Azerbaijan: Motor vehicles (per 1,000 people)","urlize_name":"Azerbaijan-Motor-vehicles-per-1-000-people","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AZE/indicators/IS.VEH.NVEH.P3?per_page=1000","description":"Motor vehicles include cars, buses, and freight vehicles but do not include two-wheelers.

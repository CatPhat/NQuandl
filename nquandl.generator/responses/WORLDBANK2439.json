Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the import volume indexes (lines 73) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nImport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2011-12-02T20:25:33.744Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:33.660Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:33.660Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6610273,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PSE_SP_POP_1015_MA_UN","name":"West Bank and Gaza: Population, aged 10-15, male","urlize_name":"West-Bank-and-Gaza-Population-aged-10-15-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PSE/indicators/SP.POP.1015.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 10-15, male is the total number of males age 10-15.\nPopulation, aged 10-15, male","created_at":"2013-05-21T19:46:21.511Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:58.920Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:58.920Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":365926,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HKG_SE_SEC_DURS_LO_","name":"Hong Kong SAR, China: Duration of education, lower secondary","urlize_name":"Hong-Kong-SAR-China-Duration-of-education-lower-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HKG/indicators/SE.SEC.DURS.LO?per_page=1000","description":"Lower secondary duration refers to the number of years of full-time equivalent duration in lower secondary education in the school system according to ISCED.\nDuration of education, lower secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T11:33:04.927Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:59.225Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:59.225Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2134978,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PLW_UIS_AY_EM","name":"Palau: Ending month of the academic year (Questionnaire A)","urlize_name":"Palau-Ending-month-of-the-academic-year-Questionnaire-A","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PLW/indicators/UIS.AY.EM?per_page=1000","description":"Ending month of the academic year (Questionnaire A)\nEnding month of the academic year (Questionnaire A)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:56:42.778Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:55:07.962Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:55:07.962Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6532671,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IND_SL_TLF_ACTI_1524_FE_ZS","name":"India: Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15-24)","urlize_name":"India-Labor-force-participation-rate-female-of-female-population-ages-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IND/indicators/SL.TLF.ACTI.1524.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 15-24 that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:54:49.836Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:58:20.373Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:58:20.373Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7775863,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_159NIGERIA2908SUGARCROPSTOTAL","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Sugarcrops + (Total) - Nigeria","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Sugarcrops-Total-Nigeria","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:05:25.977Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:43:17.655Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:43:17.655Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7666714,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_351CHINA973BUFFALOLIVEWEIGHT","name":"Prices Archive: Buffalo Live Weight - China","urlize_name":"Prices-Archive-Buffalo-Live-Weight-China","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/PricesArchive_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-04T20:22:31.532Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:23:38.430Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:23:38.430Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":285623,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DEU_SP_POP_AG01_TO_UN","name":"Germany: Population, aged  1, total","urlize_name":"Germany-Population-aged-1-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DEU/indicators/SP.POP.AG01.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 1, total refers to the total population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged  1, total","created_at":"2012-01-04T18:04:57.795Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T10:53:29.885Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T10:53:29.885Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2138002,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KWT_WP11630_2_7","name":"Kuwait: Bank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, secondary education or more (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Kuwait-Bank-teller-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-secondary-education-or-more-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KWT/indicators/WP11630.2.7?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is over the counter in a branch of one's bank or financial institution (% with a secondary education or more, age 15+, with a formal account)\nBank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, secondary education or more (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:11:03.456Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:43:23.685Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:43:23.685Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6520994,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GIN_GFDD_OI_10","name":"Guinea: Offshore bank deposits to domestic bank deposits (%)","urlize_name":"Guinea-Offshore-bank-deposits-to-domestic-bank-deposits","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GIN/indicators/GFDD.OI.10?per_page=1000","description":"Ratio of offshore bank deposits relative to domestic deposits.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c.

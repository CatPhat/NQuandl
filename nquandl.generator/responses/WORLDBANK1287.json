bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-03T01:17:00.032Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:11:07.197Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:11:07.197Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":197930,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_SP_POP_AG13_FE_IN","name":"Austria: Age population, age 13, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Austria-Age-population-age-13-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUT/indicators/SP.POP.AG13.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 13, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-01-02T15:28:29.075Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:53:43.969Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:53:43.969Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2026532,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VNM_GER_PRE_POP_ATTN_1519_FE","name":"Vietnam: Population by educational attainment, no-school, female (aged 15-19)","urlize_name":"Vietnam-Population-by-educational-attainment-no-school-female-aged-15-19","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/VNM/indicators/GER.PRE.POP.ATTN.1519.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population by educational attainment, no-school, female (aged 15-19) is the total number of females age 15-19 with no education.\nPopulation by educational attainment, no-school, female (aged 15-19)","created_at":"2012-08-06T18:34:37.150Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T18:18:53.339Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":366535,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HND_GER_SEC_POP_ATTN_7074_FE","name":"Honduras: Population by educational attainment, secondary, female (aged 70-74)","urlize_name":"Honduras-Population-by-educational-attainment-secondary-female-aged-70-74","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HND/indicators/GER.SEC.POP.ATTN.7074.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population by educational attainment, secondary, female (aged 70-74) is the total number of females age 70-74 with secondary education.\nPopulation by educational attainment, secondary, female (aged 70-74)","created_at":"2012-01-06T11:48:15.283Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:58:40.810Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":272500,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COL_GER_SEC_POP_ATTN_0004_FE","name":"Colombia: Population by educational attainment, secondary, female (aged 0-4)","urlize_name":"Colombia-Population-by-educational-attainment-secondary-female-aged-0-4","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COL/indicators/GER.SEC.POP.ATTN.0004.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population by educational attainment, secondary, female (aged 0-4) is the total number of females age 0-4 with secondary education.\nPopulation by educational attainment, secondary, female (aged 0-4)","created_at":"2012-01-04T11:01:11.202Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T16:48:05.936Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2025-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2020957,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SGP_SL_AGR_EMPL_ZS","name":"Singapore: Employment in agriculture (% of total employment)","urlize_name":"Singapore-Employment-in-agriculture-of-total-employment","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SGP/indicators/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Employees are people who work for a public or private employer and receive remuneration in wages, salary, commission, tips, piece rates, or pay in kind.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-06T14:34:07.911Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:30:31.455Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:30:31.455Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":380310,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IND_MYS_POP_5054_PRI_MF","name":"India: population in thousand, 50-54, total, primary","urlize_name":"India-population-in-thousand-50-54-total-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IND/indicators/MYS.POP.5054.PRI.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 50-54, total, primary is the total number of people age 50-54 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 50-54, total, primary","created_at":"2012-01-06T18:26:18.708Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:45:08.464Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:45:08.464Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2120959,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRL_WP11631_2_11","name":"Ireland: Bank teller is main mode of deposit into account, urban (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Ireland-Bank-teller-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-urban-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRL/indicators/WP11631.2.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is over the counter in a branch of one's bank or financial institution (% living in a rural area, age 15+, with a formal account)\nBank teller is main mode of deposit into account, urban (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:48:05.740Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:18:50.341Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:18:50.341Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2187397,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JOR_WP11626_5","name":"Jordan: Debit card, older adults (% age 25+)","urlize_name":"Jordan-Debit-card-older-adults-age-25","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/JOR/indicators/WP11626.5?per_page=1000","description":"Adults with a debit card (% age 25+)\nDebit card, older adults (% age 25+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:21:54.444Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:10:55.685Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:10:55.685Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6424242,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SEN_BAR_SEC_ICMP_2529_ZS","name":"Senegal: percentage of population (15+), 25-29, total, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Senegal-percentage-of-population-15-25-29-total-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SEN/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.2529.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 25-29, total, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the population age 25-29 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 25-29, total, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2013-05-13T21:14:42.427Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:19:25.337Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:19:25.337Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":516027,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MNG_MYS_POP_1544_PRI_FE","name":"Mongolia: population in thousand, 15-44, female, primary","urlize_name":"Mongolia-population-in-thousand-15-44-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MNG/indicators/MYS.POP.1544.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-44, female, primary is the total number of females age 15-44 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-44, female, primary","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:48:40.094Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:18:49.652Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:18:49.652Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2227062,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLV_DT_DOD_DEAE_CD_IL","name":"El Salvador: 056_T1_Gross External Debt, Liabilities.to.affiliated.enterp.

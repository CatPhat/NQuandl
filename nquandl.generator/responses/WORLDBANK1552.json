This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nSecondary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:23:02.353Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:32:28.697Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:32:28.697Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1978-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2126365,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_WP11654_2","name":"Croatia: Loan from an employer in the past year, male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Croatia-Loan-from-an-employer-in-the-past-year-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/WP11654.2?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from an employer (% male, age 15+)\nLoan from an employer in the past year, male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:15:25.815Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:58:56.316Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:58:56.316Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":233303,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BOL_DT_INT_PUBS_00_03_MO_CD","name":"Bolivia: 022_T2_Public Sector, Interest, 0 to 3 Months","urlize_name":"Bolivia-022_T2_Public-Sector-Interest-0-to-3-Months","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BOL/indicators/DT.INT.PUBS.00.03.MO.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n022_T2_Public Sector, Interest, 0 to 3 Months","created_at":"2012-01-03T07:13:45.491Z","updated_at":"2014-08-26T15:29:00.817Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-26T15:29:00.817Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-06-30","to_date":"2013-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":479679,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MLI_SP_POP_AG16_MA_IN","name":"Mali: Age population, age 16, male, interpolated","urlize_name":"Mali-Age-population-age-16-male-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MLI/indicators/SP.POP.AG16.MA.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, male refers to male population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 16, male, interpolated","created_at":"2012-01-10T17:48:01.484Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:45:39.426Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:45:39.426Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":406086,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_SP_POP_AG09_FE_IN","name":"Kenya: Age population, age 09, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Kenya-Age-population-age-09-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/SP.POP.AG09.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 09, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-01-07T06:46:42.623Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:59:35.542Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:59:35.542Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":477996,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MKD_SH_STA_OWGH_FE_ZS","name":"Macedonia, FYR: Prevalence of overweight, female (% of children under 5)","urlize_name":"Macedonia-FYR-Prevalence-of-overweight-female-of-children-under-5","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MKD/indicators/SH.STA.OWGH.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Prevalence of overweight, female (% of children under 5)\nPrevalence of overweight, female (% of children under 5)","created_at":"2012-01-10T15:59:22.805Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:24:29.931Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:24:29.931Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2069675,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MOZ_WP11628_9_1_6","name":"Mozambique: 0 deposits into & withdrawals from account in a typical month, primary education or less (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Mozambique-0-deposits-into-withdrawals-from-account-in-a-typical-month-primary-education-or-less-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MOZ/indicators/WP11628_9.1.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who do not deposit into or withdraw from their personal account(s) in a typical month.

The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nCereal production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-02T20:32:20.412Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:58:00.238Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:58:00.238Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2140497,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TZA_DT_DOD_PRVS_LT_CD","name":"Tanzania: 006_T1_Publicly-Guaranteed Private Sector (LT)","urlize_name":"Tanzania-006_T1_Publicly-Guaranteed-Private-Sector-LT","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TZA/indicators/DT.DOD.PRVS.LT.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n006_T1_Publicly-Guaranteed Private Sector (LT)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:22:48.246Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T13:24:55.357Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T13:24:55.357Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-03-31","to_date":"2013-06-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6527824,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GTM_WP11623_4_8","name":"Guatemala: Account at a formal financial institution, income, bottom 40% (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Guatemala-Account-at-a-formal-financial-institution-income-bottom-40-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GTM/indicators/WP11623_4.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults with an account (self or together with someone else) at a bank, credit union, another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives, microfinance institutions) or the post office (if applicable) including respondents who reported having a debit card (% in the first (lowest) and second income quintiles (0-40th percentile), age 15+)\nAccount at a formal financial institution, income, bottom 40% (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-17T13:24:32.434Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:14:20.652Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:14:20.652Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":392395,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ISR_NV_MNF_MTRN_ZS_UN","name":"Israel: Machinery and transport equipment (% of value added in manufacturing)","urlize_name":"Israel-Machinery-and-transport-equipment-of-value-added-in-manufacturing","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ISR/indicators/NV.MNF.MTRN.ZS.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Value added in manufacturing is the sum of gross output less the value of intermediate inputs used in production for industries classified in ISIC major division 3.

The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nCereal production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-05T20:35:53.262Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:11:05.286Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:11:05.286Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2145074,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UKR_WP11637_2","name":"Ukraine: Account used to send remittances , male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Ukraine-Account-used-to-send-remittances-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UKR/indicators/WP11637.2?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a formal account in the past 12 months to send money to family members living elsewhere (% male, age 15+)\nAccount used to send remittances , male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:43:10.785Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:28:51.741Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:28:51.741Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2082776,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUR_BAR_PRM_ICMP_3034_FE_ZS","name":"Turkey: percentage of population (15+), 30-34, female, incomplete primary","urlize_name":"Turkey-percentage-of-population-15-30-34-female-incomplete-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUR/indicators/BAR.PRM.ICMP.3034.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 30-34, female, incomplete primary is the percentage of the female population age 30-34 who did not complete primary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 30-34, female, incomplete primary","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:16:02.596Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:05:41.077Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:05:41.077Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":391499,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ISL_SE_SEC_ENRL_MA_VO_ZS","name":"Iceland: Vocational and Technical enrollment (% of total secondary enrollment), male","urlize_name":"Iceland-Vocational-and-Technical-enrollment-of-total-secondary-enrollment-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ISL/indicators/SE.SEC.ENRL.MA.VO.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Technical/vocational enrolment in secondary (ISCED 2 and 3) as % of total secondary enrolment (ISCED 2 and 3), male is the percentage of all male lower and upper secondary students enrolled in technical/vocational education programs including teacher training, expressed as a percentage of the total number of male students who are enrolled in lower and upper secondary education.\nVocational and Technical enrollment (% of total secondary enrollment), male","created_at":"2012-01-07T00:27:03.949Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:37:22.940Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:37:22.940Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2106246,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TCD_IC_CNS_LIC_ZS","name":"Chad: Licenses & Permits (% of managers surveyed ranking this as a major constraint)","urlize_name":"Chad-Licenses-Permits-of-managers-surveyed-ranking-this-as-a-major-constraint","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TCD/indicators/IC.CNS.LIC.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Is the share of senior managers who ranked licenses and permits as a major or severe constraint.  \nLicenses & Permits (% of managers surveyed ranking this as a major constraint)","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:33:01.150Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:45:37.473Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:45:37.473Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6528710,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GUY_HH_MICS_OOS_1_Q1","name":"Guyana: MICS: Proportion of out-of-school.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes.

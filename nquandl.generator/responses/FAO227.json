Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T13:04:18.344Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:16:50.480Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:16:50.480Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7824327,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_134MALTA1324CARBAMATESHERBICIDES","name":"Resources Pesticides Use: Carbamates Herbicides - Malta","urlize_name":"Resources-Pesticides-Use-Carbamates-Herbicides-Malta","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Pesticides_Use_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:55:22.987Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:58:51.010Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:58:51.010Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2006-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7755329,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5815LOWINCOMEFOODDEFICITCOUNTRIESTOTAL230CASHEWNUTSSHELLED","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cashew Nuts Shelled - Low Income Food Deficit Countries + (Total)","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cashew-Nuts-Shelled-Low-Income-Food-Deficit-Countries-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

Denominator: Estimated number of HIV-infected pregnant women in the last 12 months.  Ranges are presented for countries with low and concentrated epidemics.  The purpose of this indicator is to assess progress in preventing vertical transmission of HIV.  All data reflect values representing 12 month period ending December 2007 which have been reconciled between reporting country and UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF, unless otherwise noted.  All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year.

Primary is the number of female teachers at the primary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the primary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nPrimary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-08-06T20:20:45.415Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T19:45:00.668Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T19:45:00.668Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":530845,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NOR_SE_TER_GRAD_FE_ED_ZS","name":"Norway: Female share of graduates in education (%, tertiary)","urlize_name":"Norway-Female-share-of-graduates-in-education-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NOR/indicators/SE.TER.GRAD.FE.ED.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Female share of graduates in education (%, tertiary)\nFemale share of graduates in education (%, tertiary)","created_at":"2012-03-05T13:16:16.812Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:37:35.566Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:37:35.566Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":350524,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRD_SH_STA_BRTC_ZS","name":"Grenada: Births attended by skilled health staff (% of total)","urlize_name":"Grenada-Births-attended-by-skilled-health-staff-of-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRD/indicators/SH.STA.BRTC.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"UNICEF, State of the World's Children, Childinfo, and Demographic and Health Surveys by ICF International.\nBirths attended by skilled health staff (% of total)","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:29:18.879Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:54:19.400Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:54:19.400Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6542691,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KHM_IC_FRM_TRD_TR15","name":"Cambodia: Percent of firms exporting directly (at least 1% of sales)","urlize_name":"Cambodia-Percent-of-firms-exporting-directly-at-least-1-of-sales","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KHM/indicators/IC.FRM.TRD.TR15?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms exporting directly at least 1% of their sales.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

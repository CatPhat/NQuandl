Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

It measures the elasticity of banks revenues relative to input prices. Under perfect competition, an increase in input prices raises both marginal costs and total revenues by the same amount, and hence the H-statistic equals 1.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-07T19:10:41.312Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:57:19.169Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:57:19.169Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6611890,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_BAR_PRM_CMPT_4044_FE_ZS","name":"Rwanda: percentage of population (15+), 40-44, female, completed primary","urlize_name":"Rwanda-percentage-of-population-15-40-44-female-completed-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RWA/indicators/BAR.PRM.CMPT.4044.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 40-44, female, completed primary is the percentage of females age 40-44 who have completed primary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 40-44, female, completed primary","created_at":"2013-05-22T00:33:06.411Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:28:21.101Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:28:21.101Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6570478,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MUS_BAR_TER_SCHL_1519","name":"Mauritius: average years of tertiary schooling, 15-19, total","urlize_name":"Mauritius-average-years-of-tertiary-schooling-15-19-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MUS/indicators/BAR.TER.SCHL.1519?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of tertiary schooling, 15-19, total is the average years of tertiary education completed among people age 15-19. \naverage years of tertiary schooling, 15-19, total","created_at":"2013-05-20T14:22:53.805Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:35:38.273Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:35:38.273Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":450538,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LVA_SP_POP_AG20_FE_UN","name":"Latvia: Population, aged 20, female","urlize_name":"Latvia-Population-aged-20-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LVA/indicators/SP.POP.AG20.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 20, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 20, female","created_at":"2012-01-09T19:41:28.271Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:48:42.020Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:48:42.020Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":527272,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NGA_TX_PRI_MRCH_XD_WB","name":"Nigeria: Merchandise export price index (1987 = 100)","urlize_name":"Nigeria-Merchandise-export-price-index-1987-100","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NGA/indicators/TX.PRI.MRCH.XD.WB?per_page=1000","description":"This item is a price index measuring changes in the aggregate price level of a country's merchandise exports f.o.b. over time. \nMerchandise export price index (1987 = 100)","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:35:57.441Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:16:53.589Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:16:53.589Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1965-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":262827,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COD_AG_LND_TRAC_ZS","name":"Congo, Dem.

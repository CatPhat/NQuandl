Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the export volume indexes (lines 72) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nExport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2012-08-06T18:34:45.442Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:05:44.467Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:05:44.467Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":232735,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BRA_SP_POP_1316_MA_UN","name":"Brazil: Population, aged 13-16, male","urlize_name":"Brazil-Population-aged-13-16-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BRA/indicators/SP.POP.1316.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 13-16, male is the total number of males age 13-16.\nPopulation, aged 13-16, male","created_at":"2012-01-03T06:51:44.262Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:05:44.923Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:05:44.923Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":465918,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDA_TX_VAL_MRCH_OR_ZS","name":"Moldova: Merchandise exports to developing economies outside region (% of total merchandise exports)","urlize_name":"Moldova-Merchandise-exports-to-developing-economies-outside-region-of-total-merchandise-exports","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MDA/indicators/TX.VAL.MRCH.OR.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Merchandise exports to developing economies outside region are the sum of merchandise exports from the reporting economy to other developing economies in other World Bank regions according to the World Bank classification of economies.

It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.

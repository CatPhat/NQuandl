Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

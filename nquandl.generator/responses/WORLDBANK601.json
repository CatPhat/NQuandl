This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nTertiary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-05T03:34:44.283Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:59:43.093Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:59:43.093Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1997-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":319722,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EST_NY_ADJ_ICTR_GN_ZS","name":"Estonia: Adjusted savings: gross savings (% of GNI)","urlize_name":"Estonia-Adjusted-savings-gross-savings-of-GNI","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EST/indicators/NY.ADJ.ICTR.GN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Gross savings are the difference between gross national income and public and private consumption, plus net current transfers.\nAdjusted savings: gross savings (% of GNI)","created_at":"2012-01-05T11:27:16.655Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:23:00.950Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:23:00.950Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2121689,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZAF_SE_TER_GRAD_FE_EN_ZS","name":"South Africa: Female share of graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction (%, tertiary)","urlize_name":"South-Africa-Female-share-of-graduates-in-engineering-manufacturing-and-construction-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZAF/indicators/SE.TER.GRAD.FE.EN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Female tertiary graduates as percentage of all graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction is the number of female graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction expressed as a percentage of the total number of tertiary graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction.\nFemale share of graduates in engineering, manufacturing and construction (%, tertiary)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:51:34.554Z","updated_at":"2013-06-20T18:30:09.571Z","refreshed_at":null,"frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"1998-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":409260,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KGZ_BAR_SEC_SCHL_5559","name":"Kyrgyz Republic: average years of secondary schooling, 55-59, total","urlize_name":"Kyrgyz-Republic-average-years-of-secondary-schooling-55-59-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KGZ/indicators/BAR.SEC.SCHL.5559?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of secondary schooling, 55-59, total is the average years of secondary education completed among people age 55-59. \naverage years of secondary schooling, 55-59, total","created_at":"2012-01-07T07:52:11.281Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:37:28.192Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:37:28.192Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2068389,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BRN_UIS_E_56_F400","name":"Brunei Darussalam: Enrolment in science.

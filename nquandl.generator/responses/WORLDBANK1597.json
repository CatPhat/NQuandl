GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nGINI index","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:41:37.252Z","updated_at":"2014-08-28T03:38:23.253Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-28T03:38:23.253Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"1998-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":376765,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IND_SP_M18_2024_FE_ZS","name":"India: Women who were first married by age 18 (% of women ages 20-24)","urlize_name":"India-Women-who-were-first-married-by-age-18-of-women-ages-20-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IND/indicators/SP.M18.2024.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Women who were first married by age 18 (% of women ages 20-24)\nWomen who were first married by age 18 (% of women ages 20-24)","created_at":"2012-01-06T16:07:23.960Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:22:38.842Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:22:38.842Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2006-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":506451,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MNE_SL_TLF_TERT_ZS","name":"Montenegro: Labor force with tertiary education (% of total)","urlize_name":"Montenegro-Labor-force-with-tertiary-education-of-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MNE/indicators/SL.TLF.TERT.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Labor force with tertiary education is the proportion of labor force that has a tertiary education, as a percentage of the total labor force.\nLabor force with tertiary education (% of total)","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:04:23.866Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:34.825Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:29:34.825Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":333390,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GAB_IC_FRM_OWN_ZS","name":"Gabon: Largest shareholder ownership (%)","urlize_name":"Gabon-Largest-shareholder-ownership","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GAB/indicators/IC.FRM.OWN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage held by largest owner or owners\nLargest shareholder ownership (%)","created_at":"2012-01-05T18:44:38.658Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:05:42.826Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:05:42.826Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2088721,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TCD_IC_FRM_EXP_ZS","name":"Chad: Exporter firms (% of firms)","urlize_name":"Chad-Exporter-firms-of-firms","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TCD/indicators/IC.FRM.EXP.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of firms that export directly or indirectly.\nExporter firms (% of firms)","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:52:00.960Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T04:06:03.555Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T04:06:03.555Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2085948,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ATG_UIS_ECDP_1_GPI","name":"Antigua and Barbuda: Gender parity index for new entrants to primary education with ECCE experience","urlize_name":"Antigua-and-Barbuda-Gender-parity-index-for-new-entrants-to-primary-education-with-ECCE-experience","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ATG/indicators/UIS.ECDP.1.GPI?per_page=1000","description":"Gender parity index for new entrants to primary education with ECCE experience is the ratio of the female percentage of new entrants to primary education with ECCE experience to the male value for the same indicator.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:23:25.686Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:22:56.480Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:22:56.480Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":415875,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KIR_SN_ITK_DEFC","name":"Kiribati: Number of people who are undernourished","urlize_name":"Kiribati-Number-of-people-who-are-undernourished","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KIR/indicators/SN.ITK.DEFC?per_page=1000","description":"Number of people who are undernourished shows the number of people whose food intake is insufficient to meet dietary energy requirements continuously.\nNumber of people who are undernourished","created_at":"2012-01-07T10:11:46.039Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:12:25.261Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:12:25.261Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2041993,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MLI_WP11672_6","name":"Mali: Mobile phone used to pay bills, primary education or less (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Mali-Mobile-phone-used-to-pay-bills-primary-education-or-less-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MLI/indicators/WP11672.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a mobile phone to pay bills in the past 12 months (% with a primary education or less, age 15+)\nMobile phone used to pay bills, primary education or less (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-06T20:16:45.471Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:34:49.050Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:34:49.050Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2156843,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRQ_HH_MICS_TR_12_F","name":"Iraq: MICS: Transition rate.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

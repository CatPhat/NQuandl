The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-03T18:04:41.615Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T06:56:28.358Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T06:56:28.358Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Other Util (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7810474,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_170PERU310430POTASSIUMSULPHATE","name":"Resources Fertilizers: Potassium sulphate - Peru","urlize_name":"Resources-Fertilizers-Potassium-sulphate-Peru","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Fertilizers_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:01:00.083Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T00:11:05.341Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T00:11:05.341Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7860967,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5204CENTRALAMERICATOTAL1874FIBREBOARDTOTAL","name":"Forestry: Fibreboard + (Total) - Central America + (Total)","urlize_name":"Forestry-Fibreboard-Total-Central-America-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T21:07:33.434Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T00:04:46.589Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T00:04:46.589Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7639519,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_179QATAR577DATES","name":"Prices: Dates - Qatar","urlize_name":"Prices-Dates-Qatar","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Prices_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:40:34.374Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T22:17:13.577Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-24T22:17:13.577Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7856196,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_79GERMANY1871OTHERINDUSTROUNDWDTOTAL","name":"Forestry: Other Indust Roundwd + (Total) - Germany","urlize_name":"Forestry-Other-Indust-Roundwd-Total-Germany","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-02T17:57:43.070Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:20:00.454Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:20:00.454Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Seed (tonnes)","Waste (tonnes)","Food (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7733758,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_185RUSSIANFEDERATION486BANANAS","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Bananas - Russian Federation","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Bananas-Russian-Federation","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

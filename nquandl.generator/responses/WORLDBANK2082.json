Household final consumption expenditure (private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes payments and fees to governments to obtain permits and licenses. Here, household consumption expenditure includes the expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country.\nHousehold final consumption expenditure per capita growth (annual %)","created_at":"2012-01-03T06:17:56.227Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:26:42.711Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:26:42.711Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1981-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2037700,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"FRA_DB_SEV_PAY_5YR","name":"France: Severance pay for redundancy dismissal (for a worker with 5 years of tenure, in salary weeks)","urlize_name":"France-Severance-pay-for-redundancy-dismissal-for-a-worker-with-5-years-of-tenure-in-salary-weeks","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/FRA/indicators/db_sev_pay_5yr?per_page=1000","description":"Severance pay for redundancy dismissal (for a worker with 5 years of tenure, in salary weeks)\nSeverance pay for redundancy dismissal (for a worker with 5 years of tenure, in salary weeks)","created_at":"2012-08-06T19:51:48.831Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:26:42.723Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:26:42.723Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2010-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":378370,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IND_DT_DIS_DPNG_CD","name":"India: Disbursements on external debt, private nonguaranteed (PNG) (DIS, current US$)","urlize_name":"India-Disbursements-on-external-debt-private-nonguaranteed-PNG-DIS-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IND/indicators/DT.DIS.DPNG.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Private nonguaranteed external debt is an external obligation of a private debtor that is not guaranteed for repayment by a public entity.

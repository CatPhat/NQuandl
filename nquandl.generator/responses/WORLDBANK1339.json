Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-07T04:22:49.364Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:07:08.714Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:07:08.714Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1989-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2059364,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LVA_WP11630_1_7","name":"Latvia: ATM is main mode of withdrawal from account, secondary education or more (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Latvia-ATM-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-secondary-education-or-more-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LVA/indicators/WP11630.1.7?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is an ATM (% with a secondary education or more, age 15+, with a formal account)\nATM is main mode of withdrawal from account, secondary education or more (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-07T21:10:08.991Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:52:42.257Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:52:42.257Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":529677,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NLD_SE_XPD_TERT_PC_ZS","name":"Netherlands: Expenditure per student, tertiary (% of GDP per capita)","urlize_name":"Netherlands-Expenditure-per-student-tertiary-of-GDP-per-capita","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NLD/indicators/SE.XPD.TERT.PC.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Public expenditure per pupil as a % of GDP per capita.

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-02T17:49:22.441Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:54:39.728Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:54:39.728Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1962-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":371876,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_MYS_POP_1564_PRI_FE","name":"Croatia: population in thousand, 15-64, female, primary","urlize_name":"Croatia-population-in-thousand-15-64-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/MYS.POP.1564.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-64, female, primary is the total number of females age 15-64 (in thousands) with primary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-64, female, primary","created_at":"2012-01-06T14:06:30.889Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:55:16.143Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:55:16.143Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2048329,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MYS_UIS_XSPENDP_1234_FDPUB_FNS","name":"Malaysia: Educational expenditure on salaries as a % of total educational expenditure on public institutions.

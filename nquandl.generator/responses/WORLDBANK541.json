A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-04T23:43:27.072Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:48:24.352Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:48:24.352Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2210714,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SDN_WP11637_1","name":"Sudan: Account used to send remittances  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Sudan-Account-used-to-send-remittances-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SDN/indicators/WP11637.1?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a formal account in the past 12 months to send money to family members living elsewhere (% age 15+)\nAccount used to send remittances  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:32:52.230Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:45:21.414Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:45:21.414Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":313126,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ERI_DT_TDS_DECT_GD_ZS","name":"Eritrea: Total debt service (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Eritrea-Total-debt-service-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ERI/indicators/DT.TDS.DECT.GD.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Total debt service is the sum of principal repayments and interest actually paid in foreign currency, goods, or services on long-term debt, interest paid on short-term debt, and repayments (repurchases and charges) to the IMF.\nTotal debt service (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-05T08:24:38.034Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:41:16.676Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:41:16.676Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1994-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6586309,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NPL_SL_MNF_0714_ZS","name":"Nepal: Child employment in manufacturing (% of economically active children ages 7-14)","urlize_name":"Nepal-Child-employment-in-manufacturing-of-economically-active-children-ages-7-14","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NPL/indicators/SL.MNF.0714.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Employment by economic activity refers to the distribution of economically active children by the major industrial categories (ISIC revision 2 or revision 3).

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children.

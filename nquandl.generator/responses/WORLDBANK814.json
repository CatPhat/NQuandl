The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.\nGross non-food production index (1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-05T22:34:44.007Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:24:28.097Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:24:28.097Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2113233,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_IC_FRM_INFRA_IN11","name":"Sierra Leone: Percent of firms identifying transportation as a major constraint","urlize_name":"Sierra-Leone-Percent-of-firms-identifying-transportation-as-a-major-constraint","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLE/indicators/IC.FRM.INFRA.IN11?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms identifying transportation as a major constraint.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

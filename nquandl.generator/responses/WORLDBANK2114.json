Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the export volume indexes (lines 72) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nExport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:55:34.535Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.094Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.094Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2265208,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRY_DT_INT_DECT_GN_ZS","name":"Paraguay: Interest payments on external debt (% of GNI)","urlize_name":"Paraguay-Interest-payments-on-external-debt-of-GNI","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRY/indicators/DT.INT.DECT.GN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Total interest payments to gross national income.\nInterest payments on external debt (% of GNI)","created_at":"2012-08-09T10:58:42.765Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.123Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.123Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":189895,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARG_SP_POP_1319_TO_UN","name":"Argentina: Population, aged 13-19, total","urlize_name":"Argentina-Population-aged-13-19-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARG/indicators/SP.POP.1319.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 13-19, total is the total population age 13-19.\nPopulation, aged 13-19, total","created_at":"2012-01-02T11:14:50.295Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.255Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.255Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":295305,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DZA_SP_POP_AG22_MA_UN","name":"Algeria: Population, aged 22, male","urlize_name":"Algeria-Population-aged-22-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DZA/indicators/SP.POP.AG22.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 22, male refers to the male population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 22, male","created_at":"2012-01-04T22:35:37.976Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.291Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:52.291Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2219249,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVK_FM_LBL_MQMY_GD_ZS","name":"Slovak Republic: Money and quasi money (M2) as % of GDP","urlize_name":"Slovak-Republic-Money-and-quasi-money-M2-as-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVK/indicators/FM.LBL.MQMY.GD.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Money and quasi money comprise the sum of currency outside banks, demand deposits other than those of the central government, and the time, savings, and foreign currency deposits of resident sectors other than the central government.

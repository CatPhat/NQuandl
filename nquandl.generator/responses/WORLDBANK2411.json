Excluded are loans from funds administered by an international organization on behalf of a single donor government; these are classified as loans from governments.

It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.

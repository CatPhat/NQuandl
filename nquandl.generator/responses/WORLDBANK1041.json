Diversification index that ranges from 0 to 1 reveals the extent of the differences between the structure of trade of the country or country group and the world average. The index value closer to 1 indicates a bigger difference from the world average. It is constructed as the inverse of a Herfindahl index, using disaggregated exports at 4 digits (following the STIC3).  This index is a modified Finger-Kreinin measure of similarity in trade.

Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (% of central government expenditure)","created_at":"2012-01-04T08:12:46.345Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:09:36.729Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:09:36.729Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"1999-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2098805,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SGP_MYS_POP_65UP_TER_MA","name":"Singapore: population in thousand, 65+, male, tertiary","urlize_name":"Singapore-population-in-thousand-65-male-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SGP/indicators/MYS.POP.65UP.TER.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 65+, male, tertiary is the total number of males over age 65 (in thousands) with tertiary education.\npopulation in thousand, 65+, male, tertiary","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:48:34.980Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:37:20.086Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:37:20.086Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6443411,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVN_IC_FRM_WRKF_WK7","name":"Slovenia: Number of permanent non-production workers","urlize_name":"Slovenia-Number-of-permanent-non-production-workers","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVN/indicators/IC.FRM.WRKF.WK7?per_page=1000","description":"Number of permanent non-production workers.

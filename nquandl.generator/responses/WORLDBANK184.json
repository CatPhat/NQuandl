This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring). The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-07T20:12:37.228Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:35.784Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:35.784Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":386441,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRN_MYS_PROP_65UP_TER_MA","name":"Iran, Islamic Rep.: proportion, 65+, male, tertiary","urlize_name":"Iran-Islamic-Rep-proportion-65-male-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRN/indicators/MYS.PROP.65UP.TER.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 65+, male, tertiary is the proportion of the male population over age 65 with tertiary education.\nproportion, 65+, male, tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-06T21:43:34.517Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:44:24.743Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:44:24.743Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6429666,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_HH_DHS_NIR_1_Q5","name":"Sierra Leone: DHS: Net intake rate for the first grade of primary education.

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-05T22:31:35.905Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:15:18.811Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:15:18.811Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":345429,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GIN_IC_REG_XQ","name":"Guinea: Starting a business (rank)","urlize_name":"Guinea-Starting-a-business-rank","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GIN/indicators/IC.REG.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"This index averages the country's percentile rankings on: procedures, time, cost (% of income per capita) and minimum capital (% of income per capita)\nStarting a business (rank)","created_at":"2012-01-06T00:04:44.444Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:07:04.251Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:07:04.251Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":312246,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ERI_DT_DOD_DLTF_CD","name":"Eritrea: Debt outstanding and disbursed, Long-term debt including IMF credit (DOD, current US$)","urlize_name":"Eritrea-Debt-outstanding-and-disbursed-Long-term-debt-including-IMF-credit-DOD-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ERI/indicators/DT.DOD.DLTF.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Long-term debt is debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year.

Intentional homicide does not include all intentional killing; the difference is usually in the organization of the killing. Individuals or small groups usually commit homicide, whereas killing in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly cohesive groups of up to several hundred members and is thus usually excluded.\nIntentional homicides (per 100,000 people)","created_at":"2012-08-09T09:24:17.868Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:26:21.238Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:26:21.238Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6442099,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVN_BAR_PRM_SCHL_25UP_FE","name":"Slovenia: average years of primary schooling, 25+, female","urlize_name":"Slovenia-average-years-of-primary-schooling-25-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVN/indicators/BAR.PRM.SCHL.25UP.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of primary schooling, 25+, female is the average years of primary education completed among females over age 25. \naverage years of primary schooling, 25+, female","created_at":"2013-05-14T12:02:24.544Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:33:03.486Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:33:03.486Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2024257,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ALB_EQ_PAY_EQ_WK","name":"Albania: Do legal provisions mandate equal pay for equal work (1=Yes, 0=No)?","urlize_name":"Albania-Do-legal-provisions-mandate-equal-pay-for-equal-work-1-Yes-0-No","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ALB/indicators/eq_pay_eq_wk?per_page=1000","description":"Are there laws or constitutional provisions mandating equal pay between men and women for work of equal value?

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2013-05-20T19:31:11.921Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:16:47.399Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:16:47.399Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6424216,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SEN_BAR_SEC_CMPT_3034_ZS","name":"Senegal: percentage of population (15+), 30-34, total, completed secondary","urlize_name":"Senegal-percentage-of-population-15-30-34-total-completed-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SEN/indicators/BAR.SEC.CMPT.3034.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 30-34, total, completed secondary is the percentage of people age 30-34 who have completed secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 30-34, total, completed secondary","created_at":"2013-05-13T21:14:09.695Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:34:39.494Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:34:39.494Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2048927,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SAU_WP11630_1_11","name":"Saudi Arabia: ATM is main mode of withdrawal from account, urban (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Saudi-Arabia-ATM-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-urban-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SAU/indicators/WP11630.1.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is an ATM (% living in a rural area, age 15+, with a formal account)\nATM is main mode of withdrawal from account, urban (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-06T20:51:35.620Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T19:22:13.306Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T19:22:13.306Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":208550,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEL_MYS_MEA_YSCH_3034_FE","name":"Belgium: mean years of schooling, 30 -

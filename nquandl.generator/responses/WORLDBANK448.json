Household final consumption expenditure (private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes payments and fees to governments to obtain permits and licenses. Here, household consumption expenditure includes the expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country.\nHousehold final consumption expenditure per capita growth (annual %)","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:46:48.433Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:14.792Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:14.792Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1968-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":210515,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEL_SE_PRM_AGES","name":"Belgium: Primary school starting age (years)","urlize_name":"Belgium-Primary-school-starting-age-years","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEL/indicators/SE.PRM.AGES?per_page=1000","description":"Entrance age of primary is the age at which students would enter primary education, assuming they had started at the official entrance age for the lowest level of education, had studied full-time throughout and had progressed through the system without repeating or skipping a grade.\nPrimary school starting age (years)","created_at":"2012-01-02T21:08:12.605Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:20.176Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:20.176Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2228834,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SVK_UIS_FOSEP_56_F140","name":"Slovak Republic: Percentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in education","urlize_name":"Slovak-Republic-Percentage-of-tertiary-enrolments-ISCED-5-and-6-in-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SVK/indicators/UIS.FOSEP.56.F140?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in education is the percentage of all tertiary students who are enrolled in education programmes.\nPercentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in education","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:18:05.290Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:17.690Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:17.690Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2255159,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"THA_WP11671_9","name":"Thailand: Outstanding loan for funerals or weddings, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Thailand-Outstanding-loan-for-funerals-or-weddings-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/THA/indicators/WP11671.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out for funerals or weddings (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nOutstanding loan for funerals or weddings, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T09:58:12.501Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:29.506Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:11:29.506Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2060652,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDA_HH_DHS_SCR","name":"Moldova: DHS: Secondary completion rate","urlize_name":"Moldova-DHS-Secondary-completion-rate","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MDA/indicators/HH.DHS.SCR?per_page=1000","description":"Secondary completion rate is the total number of students of any age in last grade of secondary school, minus the number of repeaters in that grade, divided by the number of children of official graduation age.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

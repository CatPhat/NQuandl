official flows from UN agencies are the net disbursements of total official flows from the UN agencies. Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Note that this type of concentration indicator tends to be quite vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations in relative-prices, in a way that commodity price rises make commodity exporters look more concentrated.  \nExport product concentration index","created_at":"2012-01-10T17:59:38.774Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:18:25.962Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:18:25.962Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":368694,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_DT_AMT_DECT_CD_CB_1318","name":"Croatia: 167_T3_Debt-Service Payment Schedule, Banks, Principal (Banks) (13-18 months)","urlize_name":"Croatia-167_T3_Debt-Service-Payment-Schedule-Banks-Principal-Banks-13-18-months","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/DT.AMT.DECT.CD.CB.1318?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n167_T3_Debt-Service Payment Schedule, Banks, Principal (Banks) (13-18 months)","created_at":"2012-01-06T12:47:21.639Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T09:48:41.362Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T09:48:41.362Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":375393,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HTI_MYS_PROP_5559_SEC_MF","name":"Haiti: proportion, 55-59, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Haiti-proportion-55-59-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HTI/indicators/MYS.PROP.5559.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 55-59, total, secondary is the proportion of the population age 55-59 with secondary education.\nproportion, 55-59, total, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T15:32:31.830Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:03:59.777Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:03:59.777Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":415713,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KHM_EN_ATM_HFCG_KT_CE","name":"Cambodia: HFC gas emissions (thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent)","urlize_name":"Cambodia-HFC-gas-emissions-thousand-metric-tons-of-CO2-equivalent","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KHM/indicators/EN.ATM.HFCG.KT.CE?per_page=1000","description":"Hydrofluorocarbons, used as a replacement for chlorofluorocarbons, are used mainly in refrigeration and semiconductor manufacturing.\nHFC gas emissions (thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent)","created_at":"2012-01-07T10:06:22.632Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:04:14.762Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:04:14.762Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":375268,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HTI_MYS_PROP_4549_SEC_MF","name":"Haiti: proportion, 45-49, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Haiti-proportion-45-49-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HTI/indicators/MYS.PROP.4549.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 45-49, total, secondary is the proportion of the population age 45-49 with secondary education.\nproportion, 45-49, total, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T15:30:27.562Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:49:55.745Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:49:55.745Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2131549,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KWT_WP11628_1_6","name":"Kuwait: 0 deposits into account in a typical month, primary education or less (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Kuwait-0-deposits-into-account-in-a-typical-month-primary-education-or-less-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KWT/indicators/WP11628.1.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make zero deposits into their personal account(s) in a typical month.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

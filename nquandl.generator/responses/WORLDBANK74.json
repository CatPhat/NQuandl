Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-08-09T00:17:59.298Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:08:51.597Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:08:51.597Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1964-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6492832,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_WP11652_3","name":"Uganda: Loan through store credit in the past year, female (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Uganda-Loan-through-store-credit-in-the-past-year-female-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/WP11652.3?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a store by using installment credit or buying on credit (% female, age 15+)\nLoan through store credit in the past year, female (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-15T12:50:53.195Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:58:21.996Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:58:21.996Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2182533,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GAB_IC_FRM_GEN_GEND1","name":"Gabon: Percent of firms with female participation in ownership","urlize_name":"Gabon-Percent-of-firms-with-female-participation-in-ownership","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GAB/indicators/IC.FRM.GEN.GEND1?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms with female participation in ownership.

floods and extreme temperatures is the annual average percentage of the population that is affected by natural disasters classified as either droughts, floods, or extreme temperature events.  A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-04T10:49:55.090Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:03:24.267Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:03:24.267Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2126773,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_BAR_SEC_ICMP_75UP_FE_ZS","name":"Sierra Leone: percentage of population (15+), 75+, female, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Sierra-Leone-percentage-of-population-15-75-female-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLE/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.75UP.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 75+, female, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the female population over age 75 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 75+, female, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:16:52.032Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:09:17.278Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:09:17.278Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2024364,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SDN_GB_FIN_ABRD_CN","name":"Sudan: External borrowing, net (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Sudan-External-borrowing-net-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SDN/indicators/GB.FIN.ABRD.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Financing from abroad (obtained from nonresidents) refer to the means by which a government provides financial resources to cover a budget deficit or allocates financial resources arising from a budget surplus.

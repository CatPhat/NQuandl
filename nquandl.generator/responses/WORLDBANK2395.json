Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Details of the survey methodology are in Arvis and others' Connecting to Compete 2010: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy (2010).

The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Details of the survey methodology are in Arvis and others' Connecting to Compete 2010: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy (2010). Respondents evaluated the quality of trade and transport related infrastructure (e.g. ports, railroads, roads, information technology), on a rating ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high).

The time calculation for a procedure starts from the moment it is initiated and runs until it is completed. If a procedure can be accelerated for an additional cost, the fastest legal procedure is chosen. It is assumed that neither the exporter nor the importer wastes time and that each commits to completing each remaining procedure without delay. Procedures that can be completed in parallel are measured as simultaneous. The waiting time between procedures--for example, during unloading of the cargo--is included in the measure.\nTime to export (days)","created_at":"2012-01-09T13:46:14.207Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:00:40.182Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:00:40.182Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6493312,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UMC_AG_LND_AGRI_ZS","name":"Upper middle income: Agricultural land (% of land area)","urlize_name":"Upper-middle-income-Agricultural-land-of-land-area","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UMC/indicators/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Agricultural land refers to the share of land area that is arable, under permanent crops, and under permanent pastures.

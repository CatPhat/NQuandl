Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:50:43.823Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T00:11:04.041Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T00:11:04.041Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7633642,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_144MOZAMBIQUE574PINEAPPLES","name":"Prices Archive: Pineapples - Mozambique","urlize_name":"Prices-Archive-Pineapples-Mozambique","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/PricesArchive_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

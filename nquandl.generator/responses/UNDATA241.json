The National Accounts Main Aggregates database is produced and maintained by the Economic Statistics Branch of the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), with input from the UNSD, international organizations, and the national statistical agencies of more than 200 countries.  The database consists of a complete and consistent record of the main National Accounts of each UN member state, from 1970 onwards.  Records are based on official country data reported to the UNSD, supplemented with estimates for any years and countries with incomplete or inconsistent information.  The database is updated in December of each year. The database covers the main aggregates in the national accounts, such as GDP, income, saving, value added by industry, household spending and government expenditure, along with the relationships between these.  The database also includes detailed statistics for institutional sectors (including the rest of the world), comprising the production account, the generation of income account, the allocation of primary income account, the secondary distribution of income account, the use of disposable income account, the capital account and the financial account, if they are compiled by countries.. Different series numbers (column “Series”) are used to store different time-series versions of national accounts statistics. Series numbers with two digits (10,20) refer to data compiled following the 1968 SNA national accounts methodology, while series numbers with three digits (100, 200, etc) refer to data compiled using the 1993 SNA national accounts methodology, and series numbers with four digits (1000, 1100, etc) refer to data compiled using the 2008 SNA national accounts methodology. In addition to different methodologies, different series numbers are used when data are reported in different currencies, fiscal years, or by different sources. Furthermore, data are stored under a new series number whenever there are significant changes in compilation practices which make the time series no longer comparable.","created_at":"2014-02-21T19:56:57.929Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T19:56:58.561Z","refreshed_at":"2014-02-21T19:56:58.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2006-12-31","column_names":["Date","Equals: Household final consumption expenditure in domestic market"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9787421,"source_id":5449,"source_code":"UNDATA","code":"GID_WSHR_ARG","name":"Manufacture Of Washers And Driers In Argentina","urlize_name":"Manufacture-Of-Washers-And-Driers-In-Argentina","display_url":null,"description":"Data Sources: UNICSD and FAOSTAT.

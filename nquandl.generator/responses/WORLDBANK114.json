Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2013-05-18T23:49:14.603Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T21:20:12.681Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-21T21:20:12.681Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":314982,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EST_BAR_TER_ICMP_15UP_ZS","name":"Estonia: percentage of population (15+), 15+, total, incomplete tertiary","urlize_name":"Estonia-percentage-of-population-15-15-total-incomplete-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EST/indicators/BAR.TER.ICMP.15UP.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 15+, total, incomplete tertiary is the percentage of the population over age 15 who did not complete tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 15+, total, incomplete tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-05T09:18:58.785Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:33.523Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:33.523Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6422319,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AFG_UIS_SR_1_G5_GPI","name":"Afghanistan: Gender parity index for survival rate to grade 5","urlize_name":"Afghanistan-Gender-parity-index-for-survival-rate-to-grade-5","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AFG/indicators/UIS.SR.1.G5.GPI?per_page=1000","description":"Gender parity index for survival rate to grade 5 is the ratio of female survival rate to grade 5 to the male survival rate to grade 5.

The calculation takes into account whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern as well as costs and the loss in value due to the time spent closing down. If the business keeps operating, no value is lost on the initial claim, set at 100 cents on the dollar. If it does not, the initial 100 cents on the dollar are reduced to 70 cents on the dollar. Then the official costs of the insolvency procedure are deducted (1 cent for each percentage of the initial value). Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is taken into account, including the loss of value due to depreciation of the hotel furniture. Consistent with international accounting practice, the depreciation rate for furniture is taken to be 20%. The furniture is assumed to account for a quarter of the total value of assets. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2006 lending rates from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics, supplemented with data from central banks.

Each entry in the country’s schedule is assigned scores based on its relative restrictiveness, using a criteria set out by Bernard Hoekman’s methodology.  That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Commitments Index, all service sectors (0 least liberal to 100 most liberal)","created_at":"2012-01-07T06:54:24.584Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:36:39.003Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:36:39.003Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":231262,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BLZ_MYS_PROP_3539_NED_MF","name":"Belize: proportion, 35-39, total, no education","urlize_name":"Belize-proportion-35-39-total-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BLZ/indicators/MYS.PROP.3539.NED.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 35-39, total, no education is the proportion of the population age 35-39 with no education.\nproportion, 35-39, total, no education","created_at":"2012-01-03T06:10:29.001Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:39:17.638Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:39:17.638Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":246823,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CAF_FM_ASC_NFRG_CN","name":"Central African Republic: Net foreign assets, flow (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Central-African-Republic-Net-foreign-assets-flow-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CAF/indicators/FM.ASC.NFRG.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Net foreign assets are the sum of foreign assets held by monetary authorities and deposit money banks, less their foreign liabilities.

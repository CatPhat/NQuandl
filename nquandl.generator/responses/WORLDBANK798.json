A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nGINI index","created_at":"2013-05-21T14:04:22.367Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:41:24.616Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:41:24.616Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"1996-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":285650,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DEU_SP_POP_AG04_FE_UN","name":"Germany: Population, aged  4, female","urlize_name":"Germany-Population-aged-4-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DEU/indicators/SP.POP.AG04.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 4, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged  4, female","created_at":"2012-01-04T18:05:22.366Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:21:12.503Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:21:12.503Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":215629,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BFA_MYS_POP_15UP_SEC_MA","name":"Burkina Faso: population in thousand, 15+, male, secondary","urlize_name":"Burkina-Faso-population-in-thousand-15-male-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BFA/indicators/MYS.POP.15UP.SEC.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15+, male, secondary is the total number of males over age 15 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15+, male, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-02T22:55:21.998Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:00:34.250Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:00:34.250Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2266904,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VCT_IT_CEL_SETS","name":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Mobile cellular subscriptions","urlize_name":"St-Vincent-and-the-Grenadines-Mobile-cellular-subscriptions","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/VCT/indicators/IT.CEL.SETS?per_page=1000","description":"Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions are subscriptions to a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which provide access to the public switched telephone network.

Private transactions are those undertaken by firms and individuals resident in the reporting country. Portfolio investment corresponds to bonds and equities. Inflows into emerging countries’ stocks markets, are, however, heavily understated. Accordingly, the coverage of portfolio investment differs in these regards from the coverage of bank claims, which include indistinguishably export credit lending by banks. The bank claims data represent the net change in banks’ claims after adjustment to eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates. They are therefore a proxy for net flow data, but are not themselves a net flow figure. They differ in two further regards from other OECD data. First, they relate to loans by banks resident in countries which report quarterly to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

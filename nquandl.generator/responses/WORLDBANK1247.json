A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-05T06:10:20.701Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:07:52.700Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:07:52.700Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2277143,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"YEM_TX_DVR_MRKT_XQ","name":"Yemen, Rep.: Market export diversification index (0=less concentrated; 1=more concentrated)","urlize_name":"Yemen-Rep-Market-export-diversification-index-0-less-concentrated-1-more-concentrated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/YEM/indicators/TX.DVR.MRKT.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"Market export diversification (Herfindahl) index is a flow-weighted concentration index normalized to a range between 0 and 1--one being more concentrated.

Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

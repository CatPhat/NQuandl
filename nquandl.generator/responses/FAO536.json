The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:02:31.505Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:57:03.051Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:57:03.051Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7679418,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_195SENEGAL1937MILKFRESHTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Milk Fresh + (Total) - Senegal","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Milk-Fresh-Total-Senegal","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:27:34.724Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T14:15:24.840Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T14:15:24.840Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Area (1000 Ha)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7662774,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5305WESTERNASIATOTAL1182HONEYNATURAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Honey, natural - Western Asia + (Total)","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Honey-natural-Western-Asia-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T20:52:01.782Z","updated_at":"2014-01-13T22:54:14.554Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-13T22:54:14.554Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7840404,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_169PARAGUAY5058ENTERICFERMENTATION","name":"Emissions Agriculture: Enteric Fermentation - Paraguay","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Enteric-Fermentation-Paraguay","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Agriculture_total_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:44:04.087Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:17:28.032Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:17:28.032Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Seed (tonnes)","Waste (tonnes)","Food (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7682281,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_226UGANDA909PRODOFNATMILKCONSTIT","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Prod.of Nat.Milk Constit - Uganda","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Prod-of-Nat-Milk-Constit-Uganda","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period.

The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-03T17:23:30.551Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:46:57.214Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:46:57.214Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Feed (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7826953,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_237VIETNAM1416INSECTICIDES","name":"Resources Pesticides Trade: Insecticides - Viet Nam","urlize_name":"Resources-Pesticides-Trade-Insecticides-Viet-Nam","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Pesticides_Trade_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

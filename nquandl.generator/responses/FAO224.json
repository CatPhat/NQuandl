Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:53:28.165Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:52.933Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:39:52.933Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7780744,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_102IRANISLAMICREPUBLICOF2918VEGETABLESTOTAL","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Vegetables + (Total) - Iran (Islamic Republic of)","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Vegetables-Total-Iran-Islamic-Republic-of","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

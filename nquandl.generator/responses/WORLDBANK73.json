The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

Secondary is the number of female teachers at the secondary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the secondary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nSecondary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-03T05:30:52.254Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:08:03.196Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:08:03.196Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1972-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":308029,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ECU_MYS_MEA_YSCH_2529_FE","name":"Ecuador: mean years of schooling, 25 - 29, female","urlize_name":"Ecuador-mean-years-of-schooling-25-29-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ECU/indicators/MYS.MEA.YSCH.2529.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Mean years of schooling, 25 - 29, female is the mean years of schooling of the female population age 25-29.\nmean years of schooling, 25 - 29, female","created_at":"2012-01-05T06:03:32.352Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T21:39:12.835Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-21T21:39:12.835Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2240200,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAK_BAR_SEC_CMPT_75UP_ZS","name":"Pakistan: percentage of population (15+), 75+, total, completed secondary","urlize_name":"Pakistan-percentage-of-population-15-75-total-completed-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAK/indicators/BAR.SEC.CMPT.75UP.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 75+, total, completed secondary is the percentage of people over age 75 who have completed secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 75+, total, completed secondary","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:23:28.879Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:08:02.979Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:08:02.979Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2140838,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZAF_IC_CNS_TAXR_ZS","name":"South Africa: Tax rates (% of managers surveyed ranking this as a major constraint)","urlize_name":"South-Africa-Tax-rates-of-managers-surveyed-ranking-this-as-a-major-constraint","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZAF/indicators/IC.CNS.TAXR.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Is the share of senior managers who ranked tax rates as a major or very severe constraint.\nTax rates (% of managers surveyed ranking this as a major constraint)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:23:53.939Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:08:02.287Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:08:02.287Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2206881,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_WP11629_2_11","name":"Georgia: 1-2 withdrawals from account in a typical month, urban (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Georgia-1-2-withdrawals-from-account-in-a-typical-month-urban-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/WP11629.2.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make 1-2 withdrawals from their personal account(s) in a typical month.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs. Regional estimates of the Boone indicator pool the bank data by regions (for more information, see Hay and Liu 1997; Boone 2001; Boone, Griffith, and Harrison 2005).

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-05T10:43:14.113Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:18:40.906Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:18:40.906Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6517708,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GAB_UIS_E_23_GPV_G1_F","name":"Gabon: Enrolment in secondary.

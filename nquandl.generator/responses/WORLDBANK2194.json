For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

The 2009 round included more than 13,000 respondents from 133 countries. Sampling follows a dual stratification based on company size and the sector of activity. Data are collected online or through in-person interviews. Responses are aggregated using sector-weighted averaging. The data for the latest year are combined with the data for the previous year to create a two-year moving average. Respondents evaluated the efficiency of customs procedures in their country. The lowest score (1) rates the customs procedure as extremely inefficient, and the highest score (7) as extremely efficient.\nBurden of customs procedure, WEF (1=extremely inefficient to 7=extremely efficient)","created_at":"2013-05-14T07:39:38.683Z","updated_at":"2014-11-23T01:46:55.056Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-23T01:46:55.056Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6615374,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RWA_NV_SRV_TOTL_CN","name":"Rwanda: Services, value added (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Rwanda-Services-value-added-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/RWA/indicators/NV.SRV.TOTL.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Services correspond to ISIC divisions 50-99.

To obtain the numerator for the NER, you can simply multiply the SAP of a relevant level by its corresponding NER.\nPupils of the official school age.  Secondary.

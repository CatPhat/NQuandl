Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes.

All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The \"\"international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nNon-food production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-04T11:24:28.204Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:06:22.558Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:06:22.558Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":230703,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BOL_SP_POP_AG09_FE_UN","name":"Bolivia: Population, aged  9, female","urlize_name":"Bolivia-Population-aged-9-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BOL/indicators/SP.POP.AG09.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 9, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged  9, female","created_at":"2012-01-03T05:55:39.564Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:38:05.579Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:38:05.579Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2149321,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_BAR_TER_CMPT_6569_FE_ZS","name":"Sierra Leone: percentage of population (15+), 65-69, female, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"Sierra-Leone-percentage-of-population-15-65-69-female-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLE/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.6569.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 65-69, female, completed tertiary is the percentage of females age 65-69 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 65-69, female, completed tertiary","created_at":"2012-08-08T23:05:08.347Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T20:42:53.309Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T20:42:53.309Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2583545,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CHN_UIS_DR_1_G4","name":"China: Drop-out rate.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger.

This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring).

Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-03-05T11:07:52.556Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:04:13.620Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:04:13.620Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2165604,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IRQ_WP11630_3_3","name":"Iraq: Retail store is main mode of withdrawal from account, female (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Iraq-Retail-store-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-female-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IRQ/indicators/WP11630.3.3?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is over the counter at a retail store (% female, age 15+, with a formal account)\nRetail store is main mode of withdrawal from account, female (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T01:04:17.202Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:43:16.621Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:43:16.621Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":428566,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LAO_EN_CLC_DRSK_XQ","name":"Lao PDR: Disaster risk reduction progress score (1-5 scale; 5=best)","urlize_name":"Lao-PDR-Disaster-risk-reduction-progress-score-1-5-scale-5-best","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LAO/indicators/EN.CLC.DRSK.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"Disaster risk reduction progress score is an average of self-assessment scores, ranging from 1 to 5, submitted by countries under Priority 1 of the Hyogo Framework National Progress Reports.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

The index ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing better performance. Data are from Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. 2009 round of surveys covered more than 5,000 country assessments by nearly 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-04T12:31:53.044Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:10.362Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:10.362Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2217430,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAK_SH_STA_BRTW_ZS","name":"Pakistan: Low-birthweight babies (% of births)","urlize_name":"Pakistan-Low-birthweight-babies-of-births","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAK/indicators/SH.STA.BRTW.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"UNICEF, State of the World's Children, Childinfo, and Demographic and Health Surveys by ICF International.\nLow-birthweight babies (% of births)","created_at":"2012-08-09T06:12:53.301Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:13:37.299Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:13:37.299Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":227642,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BLZ_BAR_SEC_ICMP_1519_FE_ZS","name":"Belize: percentage of population (15+), 15-19, female, incomplete secondary","urlize_name":"Belize-percentage-of-population-15-15-19-female-incomplete-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BLZ/indicators/BAR.SEC.ICMP.1519.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 15-19, female, incomplete secondary is the percentage of the female population age 15-19 who did not complete secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 15-19, female, incomplete secondary","created_at":"2012-01-03T04:11:04.803Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:24:38.507Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:24:38.507Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":185252,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ALB_BN_KLT_PRVT_CD","name":"Albania: Private capital flows, total (BoP, current US$)","urlize_name":"Albania-Private-capital-flows-total-BoP-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ALB/indicators/BN.KLT.PRVT.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Private capital flows consist of net foreign direct investment and portfolio investment.

This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nTertiary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:33:01.895Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:23:18.020Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:23:18.020Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"1984-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6502284,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CPV_SL_TLF_1564_FE_ZS","name":"Cape Verde: Labor force (15-64 years), female (% of total labor force 15-64 years)","urlize_name":"Cape-Verde-Labor-force-15-64-years-female-of-total-labor-force-15-64-years","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CPV/indicators/SL.TLF.1564.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"The labor force comprising people ages 15 to 64 who meet the International Labour Organization definition of the economically active population: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.

The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

Female is the total number of years of schooling which a child of a certain age can expect to receive in the future, assuming that the probability of his or her being enrolled in school at any particular age is equal to the current enrollment ratio for that age. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. The expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed because of repetition.\nSchool life expectancy (years).  Tertiary.

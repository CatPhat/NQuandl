Different series numbers (column “Series”) are used to store different time-series versions of national accounts statistics. Series numbers with two digits (10,20) refer to data compiled following the 1968 SNA national accounts methodology, while series numbers with three digits (100, 200, etc) refer to data compiled using the 1993 SNA national accounts methodology, and series numbers with four digits (1000, 1100, etc) refer to data compiled using the 2008 SNA national accounts methodology. In addition to different methodologies, different series numbers are used when data are reported in different currencies, fiscal years, or by different sources. Furthermore, data are stored under a new series number whenever there are significant changes in compilation practices which make the time series no longer comparable.","created_at":"2014-02-21T19:54:55.904Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T19:54:56.367Z","refreshed_at":"2014-02-21T19:54:56.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1986-12-31","to_date":"1991-12-31","column_names":["Date","GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT","Equals: GROSS NATIONAL INCOME","Plus: Current transfers - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Current transfers - from the rest of the world","Less: Current transfers - to the rest of the world","Equals: GROSS NATIONAL DISPOSABLE INCOME","Less: Final consumption expenditure / Actual final consumption","Equals: SAVING; GROSS","Less: Gross capital formation"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9780828,"source_id":5449,"source_code":"UNDATA","code":"NAE_GNICDPC_NOR","name":"Per Capita GNI - Norway","urlize_name":"Per-Capita-GNI-Norway","display_url":null,"description":"Norway per capita GNI at current prices - US dollars.

In addition to different methodologies, different series numbers are used when data are reported in different currencies, fiscal years, or by different sources. Furthermore, data are stored under a new series number whenever there are significant changes in compilation practices which make the time series no longer comparable.","created_at":"2014-02-21T19:56:43.029Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T19:56:43.229Z","refreshed_at":"2014-02-21T19:56:43.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","General public services","Defence","Economic affairs","Housing and community amenities","Health","Recreation; culture and religion","Education","Social protection","Equals: General government final consumption expenditure","Public order and safety","Environment protection"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":11290757,"source_id":5449,"source_code":"UNDATA","code":"INDCOM_RUBR_URY","name":"Production of Rubber - Uruguay","urlize_name":"Production-of-Rubber-Uruguay","display_url":null,"description":"Production of Rubber - Uruguay.

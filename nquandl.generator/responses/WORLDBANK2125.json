It is based on a diagnostic framework developed with a view to assessing the capacity of national statistical systems and monitoring progress in statistical development over time. The framework has three dimensions: statistical methodology; source data; and periodicity and timeliness. For each dimension, a country is scored against specific criteria, using information available from the World Bank, IMF, UN, UNESCO, and WHO. A composite score for each dimension and an overall score combining all three dimensions are derived for each country on a scale of 0-100. A score of 100 indicates that the country meets all the criteria.\nOverall level of statistical capacity (scale 0 - 100)","created_at":"2013-05-14T04:13:37.947Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:56:46.588Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:56:46.588Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":527472,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MUS_SP_POP_0713_TO_UN","name":"Mauritius: Population, aged 7-13, total","urlize_name":"Mauritius-Population-aged-7-13-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MUS/indicators/SP.POP.0713.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 7-13, total is the total population age 7-13.\nPopulation, aged 7-13, total","created_at":"2012-03-05T12:37:35.006Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:56:46.598Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:56:46.598Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6450389,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SWE_NE_DAB_DEFL_ZS","name":"Sweden: Gross national expenditure deflator (base year varies by country)","urlize_name":"Sweden-Gross-national-expenditure-deflator-base-year-varies-by-country","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SWE/indicators/NE.DAB.DEFL.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Gross national expenditure (formerly domestic absorption) is the sum of household final consumption expenditure (formerly private consumption), general government final consumption expenditure (formerly general government consumption), and gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment).\nGross national expenditure deflator (base year varies by country)","created_at":"2013-05-14T14:01:15.395Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:56:46.664Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:56:46.664Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2130719,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_HH_MICS_TR_12_Q3","name":"Sierra Leone: MICS: Transition rate.

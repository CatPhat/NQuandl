Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

(For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (% of central government expenditure)","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:41:32.622Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:15:01.583Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:15:01.583Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"1999-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":426809,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LBN_SP_POP_DPND_OL","name":"Lebanon: Age dependency ratio, old (% of working-age population)","urlize_name":"Lebanon-Age-dependency-ratio-old-of-working-age-population","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LBN/indicators/SP.POP.DPND.OL?per_page=1000","description":"World Bank staff estimates from various sources including census reports, the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects, national statistical offices, household surveys conducted by national agencies, and ICF International.\nAge dependency ratio, old (% of working-age population)","created_at":"2012-01-07T16:02:20.724Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:49:17.430Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:49:17.430Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6525341,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRC_WP11623_4_9","name":"Greece: Account at a formal financial institution, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Greece-Account-at-a-formal-financial-institution-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRC/indicators/WP11623_4.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults with an account (self or together with someone else) at a bank, credit union, another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives, microfinance institutions) or the post office (if applicable) including respondents who reported having a debit card (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nAccount at a formal financial institution, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-17T11:11:02.696Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:41:27.506Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:41:27.506Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6525350,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRC_WP11626_8","name":"Greece: Debit card, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Greece-Debit-card-income-quintiles-I-lowest-and-II-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRC/indicators/WP11626.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults with a debit card (% in the first (lowest) and second income quintiles (0-40th percentile), age 15+)\nDebit card, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-17T11:11:16.858Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:07:56.855Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:07:56.855Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2048828,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ESP_NEGDIFTOTXN","name":"Spain: Fixed Investment deflator, LCU","urlize_name":"Spain-Fixed-Investment-deflator-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ESP/indicators/NEGDIFTOTXN?per_page=1000","description":"The Fixed Investment implicit deflator is the ratio of Fixed Investment  in current local currency to Fixed Investment in constant local currency.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-01-05T23:27:47.327Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:02:38.588Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:02:38.588Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":203590,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AZE_DT_CUR_DMAK_ZS","name":"Azerbaijan: Currency composition of PPG debt, Deutsche mark (%)","urlize_name":"Azerbaijan-Currency-composition-of-PPG-debt-Deutsche-mark","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AZE/indicators/DT.CUR.DMAK.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"The percentage of external long-term public and publicly-guaranteed debt contracted in Deutsche marks for the low- and middle-income countries.\nCurrency composition of PPG debt, Deutsche mark (%)","created_at":"2012-01-02T18:11:24.586Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:45:39.002Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:45:39.002Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":350522,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRD_SH_STA_BFED_ZS","name":"Grenada: Exclusive breastfeeding (% of children under 6 months)","urlize_name":"Grenada-Exclusive-breastfeeding-of-children-under-6-months","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRD/indicators/SH.STA.BFED.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"UNICEF, State of the World's Children, Childinfo, and Demographic and Health Surveys by ICF International.\nExclusive breastfeeding (% of children under 6 months)","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:29:17.211Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:18:53.973Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:18:53.973Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1998-12-31","to_date":"1998-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2075369,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MYS_UIS_E_3_V_PU_F","name":"Malaysia: Enrolment in upper secondary.

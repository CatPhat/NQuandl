Definitions for each indicator follow.  Total debt service (TDS) shows the debt service payments on total long-term debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of IMF credit, and interest on short-term debt only. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments in the year specified.  Exports of goods, services and income is the sum of goods (merchandise) exports, exports of (nonfactor) services and income (factor) receipts.  Data are in current U.S. dollars.  Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2013-05-21T14:39:01.178Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:15:04.925Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:15:04.925Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":270743,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COM_SP_POP_AG05_FE_UN","name":"Comoros: Population, aged  5, female","urlize_name":"Comoros-Population-aged-5-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COM/indicators/SP.POP.AG05.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 5, female, (UNESCO) is the female population age 5. \nPopulation, aged  5, female","created_at":"2012-01-04T10:09:31.946Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:52:20.012Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:52:20.012Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2281001,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_WP11658_9","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Personally paid for health insurance, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Personally-paid-for-health-insurance-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/WP11658.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have health or medical insurance (in addition to national health insurance) and who personally purchased this insurance (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nPersonally paid for health insurance, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T12:37:28.997Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:28:57.689Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:28:57.689Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":305008,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_SP_POP_1519_MA_5Y","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Population ages 15-19, male (% of male population)","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Population-ages-15-19-male-of-male-population","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/SP.POP.1519.MA.5Y?per_page=1000","description":"Male population between the ages 15 to 19 as a percentage of the total male population.\nPopulation ages 15-19, male (% of male population)","created_at":"2012-01-05T04:24:04.884Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:44:47.483Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:44:47.483Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2270704,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRY_WP11654_7","name":"Paraguay: Loan from an employer in the past year, secondary education or more (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Paraguay-Loan-from-an-employer-in-the-past-year-secondary-education-or-more-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRY/indicators/WP11654.7?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from an employer (% with a secondary education or more, age 15+)\nLoan from an employer in the past year, secondary education or more (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T11:29:41.559Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:19:05.046Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:19:05.046Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":281181,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CRI_NE_GDI_FTOT_CN","name":"Costa Rica: Gross fixed capital formation (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Costa-Rica-Gross-fixed-capital-formation-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CRI/indicators/NE.GDI.FTOT.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Gross fixed capital formation (formerly gross domestic fixed investment) includes land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings.

It measures the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices measuring achievements in each dimension. The HDI is the geometric mean of the three dimension indices and embodies imperfect substitutability across all HDI dimensions. It thus addresses one of the most serious criticisms of the linear aggregation formula, which allowed for perfect substitution across dimensions. Some substitutability is inherent in the definition of any index that increases with the values of its components.

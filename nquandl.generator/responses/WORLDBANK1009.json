Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2013-05-18T20:17:49.677Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:39:00.494Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:39:00.494Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":227396,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BLZ_BAR_PRM_CMPT_3034_ZS","name":"Belize: percentage of population (15+), 30-34, total, completed primary","urlize_name":"Belize-percentage-of-population-15-30-34-total-completed-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BLZ/indicators/BAR.PRM.CMPT.3034.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 30-34, total, completed primary is the percentage of people age 30-34 who have completed primary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 30-34, total, completed primary","created_at":"2012-01-03T04:04:28.229Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:55:13.673Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:55:13.673Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2151765,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DEU_WP11631_4_4","name":"Germany: Bank agent is main mode of deposit into account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","urlize_name":"Germany-Bank-agent-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-young-adults-with-an-account-age-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DEU/indicators/WP11631.4.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is from some other person who is associated with one's bank or financial institution (% ages 15-24, with a formal account)\nBank agent is main mode of deposit into account, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","created_at":"2012-08-08T23:22:10.813Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T18:25:16.461Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T18:25:16.461Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6431068,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SMR_UIS_R_23_GPV_G7","name":"San Marino: Repeaters in secondary.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.  Pesticide trade is the value of trade covering insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and others, as described by the Harmonised Coding System (HS) code 3808.  Differences between figures given for total exports and total imports at the world level may be due to several factors, e.g. the time lag between the dispatch of goods from exporting country and their arrival in the importing country; the use of different classification of the same product by different countries; or the fact that some countries supply data on general trade while others give data on

Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

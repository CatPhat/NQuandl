A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.\nDroughts, floods, extreme temperatures (% of population, average 1990-2009)","created_at":"2012-01-06T14:43:44.773Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:23:32.892Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:23:32.892Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2148238,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"URY_FD_RES_LIQU_AS_ZS","name":"Uruguay: Bank liquid reserves to bank assets ratio (%)","urlize_name":"Uruguay-Bank-liquid-reserves-to-bank-assets-ratio","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/URY/indicators/FD.RES.LIQU.AS.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Ratio of bank liquid reserves to bank assets is the ratio of domestic currency holdings and deposits with the monetary authorities to claims on other governments, nonfinancial public enterprises, the private sector, and other banking institutions.\nBank liquid reserves to bank assets ratio (%)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:58:29.059Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:52:56.951Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:52:56.951Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2001-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2281759,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DOM_HH_DHS_NAR_23_Q5","name":"Dominican Republic: DHS: Net attendance rate.

They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nAgriculture production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:15:43.606Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:43:38.694Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:43:38.694Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6452328,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BFA_UIS_TRTP_3_M","name":"Burkina Faso: Percentage of trained teachers.

This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nPrimary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2013-05-22T01:05:29.911Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T20:14:22.199Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T20:14:22.199Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2130369,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"URY_ALLSA_GEN_Q1","name":"Uruguay: (%) Generosity of All Social Safety Nets - 1st 20%","urlize_name":"Uruguay-Generosity-of-All-Social-Safety-Nets-1st-20","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/URY/indicators/allsa.gen_q1?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the (%) Generosity of All Social Safety Nets for 1st 20% \n(%) Generosity of All Social Safety Nets - 1st 20% ","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:33:16.226Z","updated_at":"2014-08-26T15:37:25.433Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-26T15:37:25.433Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2196477,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRT_BAR_PRM_SCHL_4549","name":"Portugal: average years of primary schooling, 45-49, total","urlize_name":"Portugal-average-years-of-primary-schooling-45-49-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRT/indicators/BAR.PRM.SCHL.4549?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of primary schooling, 45-49, total is the average years of primary education completed among people age 45-49. \naverage years of primary schooling, 45-49, total","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:15:09.838Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:23:39.750Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:23:39.750Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2161621,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TLS_SH_MED_CMHW_P3","name":"Timor-Leste: Community health workers (per 1,000 people)","urlize_name":"Timor-Leste-Community-health-workers-per-1-000-people","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TLS/indicators/SH.MED.CMHW.P3?per_page=1000","description":"Community health workers include various types of community health aides, many with country-specific occupational titles such as community health officers, community health-education workers, family health workers, lady health visitors and health extension package workers.\nCommunity health workers (per 1,000 people)","created_at":"2012-08-09T00:35:21.680Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:19:08.844Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:19:08.844Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2004-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":352006,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GNQ_IT_MLT_BCONN_CN","name":"Equatorial Guinea: Business telephone connection charge (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Equatorial-Guinea-Business-telephone-connection-charge-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GNQ/indicators/IT.MLT.BCONN.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Please cite the International Telecommunication Union for third-party use of these data.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2013-05-16T01:12:25.026Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:27:50.810Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:27:50.810Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6494148,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CIV_FIN15_MO","name":"Cote d'Ivoire: Percent of male-owned SMEs with an account at a formal financial institution (5-99 employees)","urlize_name":"Cote-d-Ivoire-Percent-of-male-owned-SMEs-with-an-account-at-a-formal-financial-institution-5-99-employees","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CIV/indicators/FIN15_MO?per_page=1000","description":"Denotes the percentage of male-owned small (5-19 employees) or medium (20-99 employees) enterprises with a checking or savings account. \nPercent of male-owned SMEs with an account at a formal financial institution (5-99 employees)","created_at":"2013-05-15T15:17:19.291Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:27:50.226Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:27:50.226Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":304858,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ECS_EN_POP_EL5M_ZS","name":"Europe & Central Asia (all income levels): Population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total population)","urlize_name":"Europe-Central-Asia-all-income-levels-Population-living-in-areas-where-elevation-is-below-5-meters-of-total-population","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ECS/indicators/EN.POP.EL5M.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Population below 5m is the percentage of the total population living in areas where the elevation is 5 meters or less.\nPopulation living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total population)","created_at":"2012-01-05T04:20:50.848Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T20:32:38.477Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-21T20:32:38.477Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2268363,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SSA_WP11648_8","name":"Sub-Saharan Africa (developing only): Saved at a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Sub-Saharan-Africa-developing-only-Saved-at-a-financial-institution-in-the-past-year-income-quintiles-I-lowest-and-II-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SSA/indicators/WP11648.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved or set aside any money in the past 12 months using an account at a bank, credit union or another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives) or microfinance institution (% in the first (lowest) and second income quintiles (0-40th percentile), age 15+)\nSaved at a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T11:16:10.850Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:23:14.821Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:23:14.821Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2143849,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZAF_UIS_E_0_PU","name":"South Africa: Enrolment in pre-primary.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

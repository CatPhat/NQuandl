The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:59:22.552Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T22:05:18.422Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-24T22:05:18.422Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7659177,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_15BELGIUMLUXEMBOURG1012INDIGENOUSSHEEPMEAT","name":"Value of Production: Indigenous Sheep Meat - Belgium-Luxembourg","urlize_name":"Value-of-Production-Indigenous-Sheep-Meat-Belgium-Luxembourg","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Value_of_Production_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:59:29.878Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T22:05:43.568Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-24T22:05:43.568Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2004-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7635446,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_48COSTARICA289SESAMESEED","name":"Prices Archive: Sesame seed - Costa Rica","urlize_name":"Prices-Archive-Sesame-seed-Costa-Rica","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/PricesArchive_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:39:36.218Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T22:12:51.494Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-24T22:12:51.494Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7703367,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_103IRAQ339OILSEEDSNES","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Oilseeds, Nes - Iraq","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Oilseeds-Nes-Iraq","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T14:45:16.251Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:45:13.729Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:45:13.729Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7736909,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_203SPAIN994GREASEINCLLANOLINWOOL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Grease incl.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:30:06.893Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T22:14:34.676Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-24T22:14:34.676Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Area (1000 Ha)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7853162,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_118KUWAIT1622OTHERPAPERSPACKAGING","name":"Forestry: Other Papers Packaging - Kuwait","urlize_name":"Forestry-Other-Papers-Packaging-Kuwait","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper. For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961. These estimates are provided by countries through an annual survey conducted by FAO Forestry Department in partnership with the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources. Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T07:22:18.114Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T22:14:34.997Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-24T22:14:34.997Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7636713,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_170PERU569FIGS","name":"Prices Indices: Figs - Peru","urlize_name":"Prices-Indices-Figs-Peru","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Price_Indices_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate). Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T13:26:06.574Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T00:20:00.474Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T00:20:00.474Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false}],"sources":[{"id":863,"code":"FAO","datasets_count":192278,"description":"Comprehensive global data on food and agriculture.

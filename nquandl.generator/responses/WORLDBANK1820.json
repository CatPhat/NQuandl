This is the sum total of all fossil fuel emissions (solid fuel consumption, liquid fuel consumption, gas fuel consumption, cement production and gas flaring).

Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.   \nCO2 emissions from fossil-fuels, total (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2013-05-22T00:45:05.931Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:06:20.242Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:06:20.242Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1962-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6475684,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BRA_SI_POV_5DAY","name":"Brazil: Poverty headcount ratio at $5 a day (PPP) (% of population)","urlize_name":"Brazil-Poverty-headcount-ratio-at-5-a-day-PPP-of-population","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BRA/indicators/SI.POV.5DAY?per_page=1000","description":"Population below $5 a day is the percentage of the population living on less than $5 a day at 2005 international prices. \nPoverty headcount ratio at $5 a day (PPP) (% of population)","created_at":"2013-05-15T02:22:14.599Z","updated_at":"2014-11-23T00:24:18.528Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-23T00:24:18.528Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1981-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6539283,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_IC_ELC_TIME","name":"Kenya: Time required to get electricity (days)","urlize_name":"Kenya-Time-required-to-get-electricity-days","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/IC.ELC.TIME?per_page=1000","description":"Time required to get electricity is the number of days to obtain a permanent electricity connection.

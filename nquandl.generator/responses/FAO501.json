For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961. These estimates are provided by countries through an annual survey conducted by FAO Forestry Department in partnership with the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources. Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T18:04:32.622Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:49:48.958Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:49:48.958Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (m3)","Import Quantity (m3)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (m3)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7844297,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5000WORLDTOTAL961NONDAIRYCATTLE","name":"Emissions Agriculture Manure Left on Pasture: Non-Dairy cattle - World + (Total)","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Manure-Left-on-Pasture-Non-Dairy-cattle-World-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Manure_left_on_pasture_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

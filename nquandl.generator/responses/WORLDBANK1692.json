Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).

Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

Note that this measures the theoretical ability to use mobile cellular services if one has a cellular telephone and a subscription.  \nPopulation coverage of mobile cellular telephony (%)","created_at":"2012-01-05T22:18:05.777Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:29:05.478Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:29:05.478Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":264149,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_GB_REV_XAGT_CN_ZS","name":"Cameroon: Central government revenues, excluding all grants (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Cameroon-Central-government-revenues-excluding-all-grants-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/GB.REV.XAGT.CN.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Central government revenues, excluding all grants.  \nCentral government revenues, excluding all grants (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-04T07:41:31.720Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:16.947Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:44:16.947Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1965-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":285806,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CZE_GC_REV_GOTR_CN","name":"Czech Republic: Grants and other revenue (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Czech-Republic-Grants-and-other-revenue-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CZE/indicators/GC.REV.GOTR.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Grants and other revenue include grants from other foreign governments, international organizations, and other government units; interest; dividends; rent; requited, nonrepayable receipts for public purposes (such as fines, administrative fees, and entrepreneurial income from government owner­ship of property); and voluntary, unrequited, nonrepayable receipts other than grants.\nGrants and other revenue (current LCU)","created_at":"2012-01-04T18:08:03.344Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:59:30.267Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:59:30.267Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":406273,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_SP_POP_AG18_FE_UN","name":"Kenya: Population, aged 18, female","urlize_name":"Kenya-Population-aged-18-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/SP.POP.AG18.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 18, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 18, female","created_at":"2012-01-07T06:49:45.236Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:48.292Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:48.292Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":352090,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRD_DC_DAC_ESPL_CD","name":"Grenada: Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Spain (current US$)","urlize_name":"Grenada-Net-bilateral-aid-flows-from-DAC-donors-Spain-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRD/indicators/DC.DAC.ESPL.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC).

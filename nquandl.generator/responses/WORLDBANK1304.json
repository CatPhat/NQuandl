Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and \"work in progress.\" According to the 1993 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation.\nGross capital formation (annual % growth)","created_at":"2012-01-03T22:14:10.200Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:13:14.479Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:13:14.479Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2114304,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_WP11651_8","name":"Sierra Leone: Loan from a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Sierra-Leone-Loan-from-a-financial-institution-in-the-past-year-income-quintiles-I-lowest-and-II-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLE/indicators/WP11651.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from a bank, credit union or another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives) or microfinance institution (% in the first (lowest) and second income quintiles (0-40th percentile), age 15+)\nLoan from a financial institution in the past year, income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:14:07.668Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:13:13.571Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:13:13.571Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":476813,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEX_MYS_POP_1519_SEC_FE","name":"Mexico: population in thousand, 15-19, female, secondary","urlize_name":"Mexico-population-in-thousand-15-19-female-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MEX/indicators/MYS.POP.1519.SEC.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-19, female, secondary is the total number of females age 15-19 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-19, female, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-10T14:56:44.138Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T13:43:50.549Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T13:43:50.549Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6467792,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TGO_BAR_PRM_SCHL_3539","name":"Togo: average years of primary schooling, 35-39, total","urlize_name":"Togo-average-years-of-primary-schooling-35-39-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TGO/indicators/BAR.PRM.SCHL.3539?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of primary schooling, 35-39, total is the average years of primary education completed among people age 35-39. \naverage years of primary schooling, 35-39, total","created_at":"2013-05-14T21:52:19.858Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:37:23.629Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:37:23.629Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6468016,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TGO_BAR_TER_SCHL_2529","name":"Togo: average years of tertiary schooling, 25-29, total","urlize_name":"Togo-average-years-of-tertiary-schooling-25-29-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TGO/indicators/BAR.TER.SCHL.2529?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of tertiary schooling, 25-29, total is the average years of tertiary education completed among people age 25-29. \naverage years of tertiary schooling, 25-29, total","created_at":"2013-05-14T21:57:48.603Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:09:49.249Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:09:49.249Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6469770,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TGO_MYS_POP_2024_NED_MA","name":"Togo: population in thousand, 20 -

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at non-concessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations includes the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA).

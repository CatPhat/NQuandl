A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nGINI index","created_at":"2012-01-06T22:11:25.561Z","updated_at":"2014-11-23T00:37:23.467Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-23T00:37:23.467Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1979-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":370789,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_FM_AST_CGOV_ZG_M3","name":"Croatia: Claims on central government (annual growth as % of broad money)","urlize_name":"Croatia-Claims-on-central-government-annual-growth-as-of-broad-money","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/FM.AST.CGOV.ZG.M3?per_page=1000","description":"Claims on central government (IFS line 32AN..ZK) include loans to central government institutions net of deposits.\nClaims on central government (annual growth as % of broad money)","created_at":"2012-01-06T13:33:17.314Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:52:15.160Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:52:15.160Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1994-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2084374,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUR_NY_ADJ_DPEM_CD","name":"Turkey: Adjusted savings: particulate emission damage (current US$)","urlize_name":"Turkey-Adjusted-savings-particulate-emission-damage-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUR/indicators/NY.ADJ.DPEM.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Particulate emissions damage is calculated as the willingness to pay to avoid mortality attributable to particulate emissions.\nAdjusted savings: particulate emission damage (current US$)","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:25:46.521Z","updated_at":"2014-11-23T00:37:24.035Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-23T00:37:24.035Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":370348,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HTI_AG_YLD_CREL_KG","name":"Haiti: Cereal yield (kg per hectare)","urlize_name":"Haiti-Cereal-yield-kg-per-hectare","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HTI/indicators/AG.YLD.CREL.KG?per_page=1000","description":"Cereal yield, measured as kilograms per hectare of harvested land, includes wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains.

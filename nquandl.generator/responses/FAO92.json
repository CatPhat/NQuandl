In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:30:48.093Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:35:58.601Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:35:58.601Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Area (1000 Ha)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7804602,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_149NEPAL2855FISHMEAL","name":"Commodity Balances Livestock Fish: Fish Meal - Nepal","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Livestock-Fish-Fish-Meal-Nepal","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_LivestockFish_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T12:27:15.535Z","updated_at":"2014-01-13T00:29:48.956Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-13T00:29:48.956Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7741682,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_164PACIFICISLANDSTRUSTTERRITORY2076OTHERMEATTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Other Meat + (Total) - Pacific Islands Trust Territory","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Other-Meat-Total-Pacific-Islands-Trust-Territory","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T15:49:11.145Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:45:50.198Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:45:50.198Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1985-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7804495,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_73GEORGIA2747SILK","name":"Commodity Balances Livestock Fish: Silk - Georgia","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Livestock-Fish-Silk-Georgia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_LivestockFish_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form.

Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T13:07:57.157Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T18:03:38.476Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-11T18:03:38.476Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7687342,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_40CHILE1277RESFATTYSUBS","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Res.Fatty Subs - Chile","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Res-Fatty-Subs-Chile","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:55:12.545Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:59:27.583Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:59:27.583Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Waste (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7672158,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_59EGYPT1167OFFALSNES","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Offals Nes - Egypt","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Offals-Nes-Egypt","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

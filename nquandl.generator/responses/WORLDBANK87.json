All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The \"\"international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nNon-food production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:19:10.947Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:12:10.874Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:12:10.874Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2137034,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UKR_SP_POP_AG14_FE_IN","name":"Ukraine: Age population, age 14, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Ukraine-Age-population-age-14-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UKR/indicators/SP.POP.AG14.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 14, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:06:51.613Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:12:11.037Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:12:11.037Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":354934,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GRC_SE_SEC_TCHR_FE_ZS","name":"Greece: Secondary education, teachers (% female)","urlize_name":"Greece-Secondary-education-teachers-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GRC/indicators/SE.SEC.TCHR.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage female teachers.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

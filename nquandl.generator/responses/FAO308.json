The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T00:59:42.093Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T15:08:50.866Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T15:08:50.866Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7709519,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_171PHILIPPINES1038PORK","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Pork - Philippines","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Pork-Philippines","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T20:07:24.629Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T19:13:53.986Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-11T19:13:53.986Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7705593,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_113KYRGYZSTAN1901TEXTILEFIBRESTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Textile Fibres + (Total) - Kyrgyzstan","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Textile-Fibres-Total-Kyrgyzstan","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent.

Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T17:36:14.236Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:04:23.826Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:04:23.826Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1995-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7822280,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_14BARBADOS1341PLANTGROWTHREGULATORS","name":"Resources Pesticides Use: Plant Growth Regulators - Barbados","urlize_name":"Resources-Pesticides-Use-Plant-Growth-Regulators-Barbados","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Pesticides_Use_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain. The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:49:49.611Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:04:20.901Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:04:20.901Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1994-12-31","to_date":"1996-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7708121,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_299OCCUPIEDPALESTINIANTERRITORY1903ANIMALVEGETABLEOIL4TOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Animal Vegetable Oil -4 + (Total) - Occupied Palestinian Territory","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Animal-Vegetable-Oil-4-Total-Occupied-Palestinian-Territory","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

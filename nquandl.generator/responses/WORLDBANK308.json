Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nAgriculture production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-05T10:46:11.533Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:06:37.817Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:06:37.817Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2201789,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_WP11631_3_6","name":"Cameroon: Retail store is main mode of deposit into account, primary education or less (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Cameroon-Retail-store-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-primary-education-or-less-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/WP11631.3.6?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is over the counter at a retail store (% with a primary education or less, age 15+, with a formal account)\nRetail store is main mode of deposit into account, primary education or less (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:44:53.274Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:15:22.493Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:15:22.493Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2275314,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRY_IC_FRM_REG_REG5","name":"Paraguay: Percent of firms identifying tax administration as a major constraint","urlize_name":"Paraguay-Percent-of-firms-identifying-tax-administration-as-a-major-constraint","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRY/indicators/IC.FRM.REG.REG5?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms identifying tax administration as a major constraint.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion)","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:56:24.682Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:15:09.028Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:15:09.028Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2228092,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"IDN_WP11648_4","name":"Indonesia: Saved at a financial institution in the past year, young adults (% ages 15-24)","urlize_name":"Indonesia-Saved-at-a-financial-institution-in-the-past-year-young-adults-ages-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/IDN/indicators/WP11648.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved or set aside any money in the past 12 months using an account at a bank, credit union or another financial institution (e.g., cooperatives) or microfinance institution (% ages 15-24)\nSaved at a financial institution in the past year, young adults (% ages 15-24)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:13:40.476Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:06:48.193Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:06:48.193Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2062140,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"QAT_BAR_SCHL_5559","name":"Qatar: average years of total schooling, 55-59, total","urlize_name":"Qatar-average-years-of-total-schooling-55-59-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/QAT/indicators/BAR.SCHL.5559?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of total schooling, 55-59, total is the average years of education completed among people age 55-59. \naverage years of total schooling, 55-59, total","created_at":"2012-08-07T21:38:03.365Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:37:00.305Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:37:00.305Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6462623,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SYR_ST_INT_TRNR_CD","name":"Syrian Arab Republic: International tourism, receipts for passenger transport items (current US$)","urlize_name":"Syrian-Arab-Republic-International-tourism-receipts-for-passenger-transport-items-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SYR/indicators/ST.INT.TRNR.CD?per_page=1000","description":"International tourism receipts for passenger transport items are expenditures by international inbound visitors for all services provided in the international transportation by resident carriers.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA.

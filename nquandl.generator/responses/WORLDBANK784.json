Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-02T12:53:45.945Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:48:28.416Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:48:28.416Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6457708,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SYC_DT_ODA_NDAC_PRVT_CD","name":"Seychelles: Total ODA Private Net, non-DAC donors (current US$)","urlize_name":"Seychelles-Total-ODA-Private-Net-non-DAC-donors-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SYC/indicators/DT.ODA.NDAC.PRVT.CD?per_page=1000","description":"The transactions covered are those undertaken by residents of non-DAC Member countries.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The \"\"international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nNon-food production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-04T07:17:07.377Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:43:09.597Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:43:09.597Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2206800,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEX_ALLSP_AVT_POP","name":"Mexico: Beneficiaries' per capita transfer -  All Social Protection","urlize_name":"Mexico-Beneficiaries-per-capita-transfer-All-Social-Protection","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MEX/indicators/allsp.avt_pop?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Beneficiaries' per capita transfer for All Social Protection \nBeneficiaries' per capita transfer -  All Social Protection ","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:12:09.603Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T12:05:16.702Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T12:05:16.702Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":510962,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MMR_GC_TAX_GSRV_CN","name":"Myanmar: Taxes on goods and services (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Myanmar-Taxes-on-goods-and-services-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MMR/indicators/GC.TAX.GSRV.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Taxes on goods and services include general sales and turnover or value added taxes, selective excises on goods, selective taxes on services, taxes on the use of goods or property, taxes on extraction and production of minerals, and profits of fiscal monopolies.\nTaxes on goods and services (current LCU)","created_at":"2012-03-05T09:58:00.536Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:27:55.434Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:27:55.434Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":215710,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEN_SE_PRM_CMPT_FE_ZS","name":"Benin: Primary completion rate, female (% of relevant age group)","urlize_name":"Benin-Primary-completion-rate-female-of-relevant-age-group","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEN/indicators/SE.PRM.CMPT.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Primary completion rate.

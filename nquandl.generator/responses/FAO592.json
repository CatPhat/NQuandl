Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T22:51:18.105Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:36:13.886Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:36:13.886Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Non-fertilizer use (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7781580,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_141MONGOLIA2820GROUNDNUTSINSHELLEQ","name":"Commodity Balances Crops: Groundnuts (in Shell Eq) - Mongolia","urlize_name":"Commodity-Balances-Crops-Groundnuts-in-Shell-Eq-Mongolia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in a standardized form.

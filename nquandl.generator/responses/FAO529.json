Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T14:42:13.510Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:46:14.524Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:46:14.524Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7650952,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_197SIERRALEONE1096HORSES","name":"Emissions Agriculture Manure Management: Horses - Sierra Leone","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Manure-Management-Horses-Sierra-Leone","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Manure_Management_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T12:47:27.739Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:58:51.694Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:58:51.694Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price (LCU/tonne) (LCU)","Producer Price (SLC/tonne) (SLC)","Producer Price (USD/tonne) (USD)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7812245,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_119LATVIA310230AMMONIUMNITRATE","name":"Resources Fertilizers: Ammonium nitrate - Latvia","urlize_name":"Resources-Fertilizers-Ammonium-nitrate-Latvia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Fertilizers_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item i.e. each primary commodity availablity for human consumption which corresponds to the sources of supply and its utilisation. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T21:09:26.230Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:29:29.723Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:29:29.723Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7775032,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_124LIBYA2618PINEAPPLES","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Pineapples - Libya","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Pineapples-Libya","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2013-05-20T08:51:42.224Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:44:03.799Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:44:03.799Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6462255,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SYR_SL_EMP_WORK_ZS","name":"Syrian Arab Republic: Wage and salaried workers, total (% of total employed)","urlize_name":"Syrian-Arab-Republic-Wage-and-salaried-workers-total-of-total-employed","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SYR/indicators/SL.EMP.WORK.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Wage and salaried workers (employees) are those workers who hold the type of jobs defined as \"paid employment jobs,\" where the incumbents hold explicit (written or oral) or implicit employment contracts that give them a basic remuneration that is not directly dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work.\nWage and salaried workers, total (% of total employed)","created_at":"2013-05-14T19:19:03.027Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:53:16.073Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:53:16.073Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2001-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2159287,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SOM_MO_INDEX_PHR_XQ","name":"Somalia: Participation and Human Rights","urlize_name":"Somalia-Participation-and-Human-Rights","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SOM/indicators/MO.INDEX.PHR.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"Participation: Within this sub-category the Ibrahim Index measures: (i) Political Participation – extent to which citizens have relevant information and the freedom to participate in the political process.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions. Regional aggregates include data for economies not specified elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region.

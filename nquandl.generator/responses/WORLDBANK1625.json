Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-08-06T19:25:37.149Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:00:12.700Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:00:12.700Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":209899,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BEL_MYS_PROP_80UP_NED_FE","name":"Belgium: proportion, 80+, female, no education","urlize_name":"Belgium-proportion-80-female-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BEL/indicators/MYS.PROP.80UP.NED.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 80+, female, no education is the proportion of the female population over age 80 with no education.\nproportion, 80+, female, no education","created_at":"2012-01-02T20:53:53.510Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:17:58.477Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:17:58.477Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":191820,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARM_DT_CUR_FFRC_ZS","name":"Armenia: Currency composition of PPG debt, French franc (%)","urlize_name":"Armenia-Currency-composition-of-PPG-debt-French-franc","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARM/indicators/DT.CUR.FFRC.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"The percentage of external long-term public and publicly-guaranteed debt contracted in French francs for the low- and middle-income countries.\nCurrency composition of PPG debt, French franc (%)","created_at":"2012-01-02T12:11:53.451Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:56:05.637Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:56:05.637Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":202674,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_MYS_PROP_4549_NED_MF","name":"Austria: proportion, 45-49, total, no education","urlize_name":"Austria-proportion-45-49-total-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUT/indicators/MYS.PROP.4549.NED.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 45-49, total, no education is the proportion of the population age 45-49 with no education.\nproportion, 45-49, total, no education","created_at":"2012-01-02T17:51:34.231Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T23:32:50.274Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T23:32:50.274Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":461258,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MAR_SP_UWT_TFRT","name":"Morocco: Unmet need for contraception (% of married women ages 15-49)","urlize_name":"Morocco-Unmet-need-for-contraception-of-married-women-ages-15-49","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MAR/indicators/SP.UWT.TFRT?per_page=1000","description":"Household surveys, including Demographic and Health Surveys by ICF International and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys by UNICEF.\nUnmet need for contraception (% of married women ages 15-49)","created_at":"2012-01-10T02:46:36.634Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T19:17:20.768Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T19:17:20.768Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1992-12-31","to_date":"2004-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":309807,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_MO_INDEX_XQ","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Overall Mo Ibrahim index","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Overall-Mo-Ibrahim-index","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/MO.INDEX.XQ?per_page=1000","description":"Measures overall index on (a) Safety and rule of law (b) Participation and human rights (c) Sustainable Economic  opportunity and (d) Human development.\nOverall Mo Ibrahim index","created_at":"2012-01-05T06:51:17.444Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:50:06.149Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:50:06.149Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":247112,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BWA_NEIMPGNFSCD","name":"Botswana: Imports GNFS, current US$, millions","urlize_name":"Botswana-Imports-GNFS-current-US-millions","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BWA/indicators/NEIMPGNFSCD?per_page=1000","description":"Imports of goods and services represent the value of all goods and other market services received from the rest of the world.

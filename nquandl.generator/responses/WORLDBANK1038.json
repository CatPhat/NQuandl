All analysis of this indicator, including quoted country figures, reflect numerators which have gone through a tri agency reconciliation (UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF) process and denominators which have been estimated directly from the UNAIDS/WHO Reference group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections methodology (Spectrum).  The reconciliation process ensured all agencies reported the same country endorsed figure which was the most recent and met the definition of HIV-infected women receiving antiretroviral drugs over the last 12 months, and thus reflect a full year.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-01-07T03:54:13.483Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:18:29.925Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:18:29.925Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":276314,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"COM_NE_TRM_TRAD_XN","name":"Comoros: Terms of trade index (2000=100)","urlize_name":"Comoros-Terms-of-trade-index-2000-100","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/COM/indicators/NE.TRM.TRAD.XN?per_page=1000","description":"This is based upon goods and non-financial services from the National Accounts, that is, the terms of trade index shows the national accounts exports price index divided by the imports price index, with 2000 equaling 100.  \nTerms of trade index (2000=100)","created_at":"2012-01-04T12:36:19.514Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:45.948Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:54:45.948Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":504153,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MLT_SP_POP_AG01_FE_IN","name":"Malta: Age population, age 01, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Malta-Age-population-age-01-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MLT/indicators/SP.POP.AG01.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, age 01, female, interpolated\nAge population, age 01, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-03-05T08:44:39.945Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:58:22.291Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:58:22.291Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2126464,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TZA_BAR_NOED_6064_FE_ZS","name":"Tanzania: percentage of population (15+), 60-64, female, no education","urlize_name":"Tanzania-percentage-of-population-15-60-64-female-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TZA/indicators/BAR.NOED.6064.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 60-64, female, no education is the percentage of the female population age 60-64 with no education.\npercentage of population (15+), 60-64, female, no education","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:15:45.378Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:38:47.090Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:38:47.090Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":515624,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MLT_MYS_PROP_6064_SEC_MF","name":"Malta: proportion, 60-64, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Malta-proportion-60-64-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MLT/indicators/MYS.PROP.6064.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 60-64, total, secondary is the proportion of the population age 60-64 with secondary education.\nproportion, 60-64, total, secondary","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:42:36.600Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:24:31.820Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:24:31.820Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2162830,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TLS_IC_FRM_CRM_CRIME2_C","name":"Timor-Leste: If the establishment pays for security, average security costs (% of annual sales)","urlize_name":"Timor-Leste-If-the-establishment-pays-for-security-average-security-costs-of-annual-sales","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TLS/indicators/IC.FRM.CRM.CRIME2_C?per_page=1000","description":"If the establishment pays for security, for example equipment, personnel, or professional security services, the average security costs as a percentage of total annual sales.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

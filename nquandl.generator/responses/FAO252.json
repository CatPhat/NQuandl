On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-17T20:24:21.938Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:28:08.574Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:28:08.574Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1963-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price (LCU/tonne) (LCU)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7773789,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_45COMOROS2515RYE","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Rye - Comoros","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Rye-Comoros","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

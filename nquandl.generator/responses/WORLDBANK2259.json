Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005.

Long-term Debt Outstanding and Disbursed (LDOD) conveys information about the borrower's receipt of aid from official lenders at concessional terms as defined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.  The denominator is the sum of total goods and service exports (per the balance of payments account) and workers' remittances (per the balance of payments account).  \nDebt on Concessional terms to export ratio (% of exports)","created_at":"2013-05-14T07:26:17.447Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:36.273Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:36.273Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6557002,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LMC_WP11674_9","name":"Lower middle income: Mobile phone used to receive money , income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Lower-middle-income-Mobile-phone-used-to-receive-money-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LMC/indicators/WP11674.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a mobile phone to receive money in the past 12 months (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nMobile phone used to receive money , income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-19T11:05:53.819Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:36.820Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:01:36.820Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":508233,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MNA_DC_DAC_PRTL_CD","name":"Middle East & North Africa (developing only): Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors, Portugal (current US$)","urlize_name":"Middle-East-North-Africa-developing-only-Net-bilateral-aid-flows-from-DAC-donors-Portugal-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MNA/indicators/DC.DAC.PRTL.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC).

Tertiary is the number of female teachers at the tertiary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the tertiary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nTertiary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-04T07:31:12.334Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T16:51:58.302Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T16:51:58.302Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":334406,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_SP_POP_AG22_FE_IN","name":"Georgia: Age population, age 22, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Georgia-Age-population-age-22-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/SP.POP.AG22.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, female refers to female population at the specified age level, as estimated by World Bank staff.\nAge population, age 22, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-01-05T19:12:30.413Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T12:36:09.821Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T12:36:09.821Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":336023,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GBR_MYS_POP_1544_NED_FE","name":"United Kingdom: population in thousand, 15-44, female, no education","urlize_name":"United-Kingdom-population-in-thousand-15-44-female-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GBR/indicators/MYS.POP.1544.NED.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15-44, female, no education is the total number of females age 15-44 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 15-44, female, no education","created_at":"2012-01-05T19:53:54.878Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T16:51:03.187Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T16:51:03.187Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2129633,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_UIS_FOSEP_56_F700","name":"Croatia: Percentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in health and welfare","urlize_name":"Croatia-Percentage-of-tertiary-enrolments-ISCED-5-and-6-in-health-and-welfare","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/UIS.FOSEP.56.F700?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in health and welfare is the percentage of all tertiary students who are enrolled in health and welfare programmes.\nPercentage of tertiary enrolments (ISCED 5 and 6) in health and welfare","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:29:34.159Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:26:52.197Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:26:52.197Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2079933,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TCD_UIS_R_23_GPV_G6","name":"Chad: Repeaters in secondary.

ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients.

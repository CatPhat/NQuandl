It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States.\nPPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate ratio","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:38:52.053Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.160Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.160Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":361963,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GUY_NE_TRD_GNFS_ZS","name":"Guyana: Trade (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Guyana-Trade-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GUY/indicators/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of gross domestic product.\nTrade (% of GDP)","created_at":"2012-01-06T09:20:00.189Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.191Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:16:39.191Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":472151,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDG_NE_CON_PETC_CD","name":"Madagascar: Household final consumption expenditure, etc. (current US$)","urlize_name":"Madagascar-Household-final-consumption-expenditure-etc-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MDG/indicators/NE.CON.PETC.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Household final consumption expenditure (formerly private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households.

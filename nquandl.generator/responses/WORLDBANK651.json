Secondary is the number of female teachers at the secondary level expressed as a percentage of the total number of teachers (male and female) at the secondary level in a given school year. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students, irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism, i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nSecondary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-04T15:40:53.262Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:34:45.550Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:34:45.550Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1975-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2139342,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NOR_MYS_PROP_5559_SEC_FE","name":"Norway: proportion, 55-59, female, secondary","urlize_name":"Norway-proportion-55-59-female-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NOR/indicators/MYS.PROP.5559.SEC.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 55-59, female, secondary is the proportion of the female population age 55-59 with secondary education.\nproportion, 55-59, female, secondary","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:17:08.230Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:35:49.417Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:35:49.417Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6434085,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SRB_UIS_TRTP_0","name":"Serbia: Percentage of trained teachers.

Data are the sum of three items defined in the fifth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: workers' remittances, compensation of employees, and migrants' transfers. Remittances are classified as current private transfers from migrant workers resident in the host country for more than a year, irrespective of their immigration status, to recipients in their country of origin. Migrants' transfers are defined as the net worth of migrants who are expected to remain in the host country for more than one year that is transferred from one country to another at the time of migration. Compensation of employees is the income of migrants who have lived in the host country for less than a year.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.

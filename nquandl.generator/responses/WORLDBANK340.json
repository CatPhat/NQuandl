Primary is the ratio of female adjusted net enrolment rate for primary to the male adjusted net enrolment rate for primary. It is calculated by dividing the female value for the indicator by the male value for the indicator. A GPI equal to 1 indicates parity between females and males. In general, a value less than 1 indicates disparity in favor of males and a value greater than 1 indicates disparity in favor of females. \nGender parity index for adjusted net enrolment rate.

The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.\nGross non-food production index (1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-05T17:01:20.652Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T10:35:11.351Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T10:35:11.351Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6609604,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PRY_SI_OA_AVT_Q4","name":"Paraguay: Beneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 4th 20% population - Old Age Contributory","urlize_name":"Paraguay-Beneficiaries-per-capita-transfer-held-by-4th-20-population-Old-Age-Contributory","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PRY/indicators/si_oa.avt_q4?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the Beneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 4th 20% population for Old Age Contributory \nBeneficiaries' per capita transfer held by 4th 20% population - Old Age Contributory ","created_at":"2013-05-21T18:55:38.216Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T19:23:47.453Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T19:23:47.453Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2190058,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CZE_UIS_DR_1_G2_M","name":"Czech Republic: Drop-out rate.

Total debt service (TDS) shows the debt service payments on total long-term debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of IMF credit, and interest on short-term debt only. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments in the year specified.  Exports of goods, services and income is the sum of goods (merchandise) exports, exports of (nonfactor) services and income (factor) receipts.  Data are in current U.S. dollars.  Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI).

Quintile 4 is the number of quintile 4 children in the official primary school age range who are not attending primary or secondary education, expressed as a percentage of quintile 4 children of the official primary school age range. By definition, children in the official primary-age range, who are attending pre-primary education, are considered out-of-school. The sum of the net primary attendance rate and the proportion out of school do not add to 100 percent because the net primary attendance rate does not count students who are in secondary.\nMICS: Proportion of out-of-school.

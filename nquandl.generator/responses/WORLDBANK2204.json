When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed (LDOD) is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.  Data are divided by GDP at market prices in current U.S. dollars to facilitate comparison across economies.  \nDebt on Non-concessional terms to export ratio (% of exports)","created_at":"2013-05-20T18:45:29.947Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:11:38.249Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:11:38.249Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":453992,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MAC_SL_EMP_WORK_ZS","name":"Macao SAR, China: Wage and salaried workers, total (% of total employed)","urlize_name":"Macao-SAR-China-Wage-and-salaried-workers-total-of-total-employed","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MAC/indicators/SL.EMP.WORK.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Wage and salaried workers (employees) are those workers who hold the type of jobs defined as \"paid employment jobs,\" where the incumbents hold explicit (written or oral) or implicit employment contracts that give them a basic remuneration that is not directly dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work.\nWage and salaried workers, total (% of total employed)","created_at":"2012-01-09T23:09:45.469Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:18:46.589Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:18:46.589Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6430180,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARG_FIN14_MO","name":"Argentina: Percent of male-owned SMEs with an outstanding loan or line of credit (5-99 employees)","urlize_name":"Argentina-Percent-of-male-owned-SMEs-with-an-outstanding-loan-or-line-of-credit-5-99-employees","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARG/indicators/FIN14_MO?per_page=1000","description":"Denotes the percentage of male-owned, small (5-19 employees) or medium (20-99 employees) enterprises with a loan or line of credit from a regulated financial institution at the time of the survey. \nPercent of male-owned SMEs with an outstanding loan or line of credit (5-99 employees)","created_at":"2013-05-14T01:40:33.996Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:13:14.355Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:13:14.355Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2278836,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SSA_SE_SEC_TCAQ_MA_ZS","name":"Sub-Saharan Africa (developing only): Secondary education, teachers (% trained), male","urlize_name":"Sub-Saharan-Africa-developing-only-Secondary-education-teachers-trained-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SSA/indicators/SE.SEC.TCAQ.MA.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of trained teachers.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

This is the difference between the total debt outstanding and disbursed less debt on concessional terms.  Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

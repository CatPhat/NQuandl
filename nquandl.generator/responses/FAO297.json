The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T22:48:18.300Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:47:01.498Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:47:01.498Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1991-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","Consumption in nutrients (tonnes of nutrients)","Production Quantity in nutrients (tonnes of nutrients)","Import Quantity in nutrients (tonnes of nutrients)","Non-fertilizer use in nutrients (tonnes of nutrients)","Export Quantity in nutrients (tonnes of nutrients)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7796039,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5401EASTERNEUROPETOTAL2733PIGMEAT","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Pigmeat - Eastern Europe + (Total)","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Pigmeat-Eastern-Europe-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Details of the survey methodology are in Arvis and others' Connecting to Compete 2010: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy (2010). Respondents evaluated the overall level of competence and quality of logistics services (e.g. transport operators, customs brokers), on a rating ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Scores are averaged across all respondents.\nLogistics performance index: Competence and quality of logistics services (1=low to 5=high)","created_at":"2012-01-02T09:05:41.536Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:39:31.154Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:39:31.154Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2126864,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TZA_SL_TLF_CACT_2554_FE_ZS","name":"Tanzania: Labor participation rate, female (% of female population ages 25-54)","urlize_name":"Tanzania-Labor-participation-rate-female-of-female-population-ages-25-54","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TZA/indicators/SL.TLF.CACT.2554.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 25-54 that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.

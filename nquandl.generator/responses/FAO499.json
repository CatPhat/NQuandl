The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:56:05.081Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:31:37.180Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:31:37.180Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"1996-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7835212,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_48COSTARICA2455001PLOUGHS","name":"Investment Machinery: Ploughs - Costa Rica","urlize_name":"Investment-Machinery-Ploughs-Costa-Rica","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Investment_Machinery_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Investment Domain in FAOSTAT includes: Capital stock, External assistance to agriculture, Machinery.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:37:24.162Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:51:39.012Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:51:39.012Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7837210,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_70FRENCHPOLYNESIA2455012TRACKLAYINGTRACTORS","name":"Investment Machinery: Track-laying tractors - French Polynesia","urlize_name":"Investment-Machinery-Track-laying-tractors-French-Polynesia","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Investment_Machinery_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Investment Domain in FAOSTAT includes: Capital stock, External assistance to agriculture, Machinery.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-02T21:28:35.139Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T17:45:30.853Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T17:45:30.853Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1993-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7731172,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_173POLAND769COTTONWASTE","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cotton Waste - Poland","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cotton-Waste-Poland","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption.

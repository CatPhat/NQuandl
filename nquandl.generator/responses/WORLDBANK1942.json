It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States.\nPPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate ratio","created_at":"2012-01-03T02:31:46.507Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:13.941Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:13.941Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":195112,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARM_NE_CON_PRVT_KD_ZG","name":"Armenia: Household final consumption expenditure (annual % growth)","urlize_name":"Armenia-Household-final-consumption-expenditure-annual-growth","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARM/indicators/NE.CON.PRVT.KD.ZG?per_page=1000","description":"Annual percentage growth of household final consumption expenditure based on constant local currency.

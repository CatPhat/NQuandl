Household final consumption expenditure (formerly private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes payments and fees to governments to obtain permits and licenses. Here, household consumption expenditure includes the expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country.\nHousehold final consumption expenditure (annual % growth)","created_at":"2012-01-05T10:20:52.283Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:27:22.881Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:27:22.881Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6583512,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NOR_DP_DOD_DSLO_CR_GG_CD","name":"Norway: 005.Loans (PSDGG, ST) US$","urlize_name":"Norway-005-Loans-PSDGG-ST-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NOR/indicators/DP.DOD.DSLO.CR.GG.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n005.Loans (PSDGG, ST) US$","created_at":"2013-05-21T03:32:15.710Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:27:22.931Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:27:22.931Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-03-31","to_date":"2014-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":196031,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUS_SL_UEM_TOTL_FE_ZS","name":"Australia: Unemployment, female (% of female labor force)","urlize_name":"Australia-Unemployment-female-of-female-labor-force","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AUS/indicators/SL.UEM.TOTL.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Unemployment refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.

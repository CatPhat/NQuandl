indicator measures the extent of General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) commitments for all 155 services sub-sectors as classified by the GATS and in the four modes of the GATS.

That resulted in 1,240 scores, ranging from 0 (unbound or no commitments) to 100 (completely liberalized), with an intermediate value of 50 for partial commitments. A simple average of the subsectoral scores were used to generate aggregate sectoral scores (for the 12 main services sectors as classified by the GATS), modes scores, and market access and national treatment scores. The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.  Disaggregated indices are available for Market Access and National Treatment and for twelve subsectors: business services, communication services, construction and engineering services, distribution services, educational services, environmental services, financial services, health services, tourism services, recreational and cultural services, transport services, and other services. \nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Commitments Index, all service sectors (0 least liberal to 100 most liberal)","created_at":"2012-08-08T21:19:02.584Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:45:38.598Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:45:38.598Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":441853,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LKA_IP_PAT_NRES","name":"Sri Lanka: Patent applications, nonresidents","urlize_name":"Sri-Lanka-Patent-applications-nonresidents","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LKA/indicators/IP.PAT.NRES?per_page=1000","description":"Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure or with a national patent office for exclusive rights for an invention--a product or process that provides a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem.

The ratio of PPP conversion factor to market exchange rate is the result obtained by dividing the PPP conversion factor by the market exchange rate. The ratio, also referred to as the national price level, makes it possible to compare the cost of the bundle of goods that make up gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States.\nPPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate ratio","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:32:50.709Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:32:55.339Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:32:55.339Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":357347,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GTM_DT_INT_DECT_EX_ZS","name":"Guatemala: Interest payments on external debt (% of exports of goods, services and primary income)","urlize_name":"Guatemala-Interest-payments-on-external-debt-of-exports-of-goods-services-and-primary-income","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GTM/indicators/DT.INT.DECT.EX.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Total interest payments to exports of goods and services.\nInterest payments on external debt (% of exports of goods, services and primary income)","created_at":"2012-01-06T06:55:49.586Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:32:55.711Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:32:55.711Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1977-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":228769,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BIH_NV_IND_TOTL_KD_ZG","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina: Industry, value added (annual % growth)","urlize_name":"Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Industry-value-added-annual-growth","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BIH/indicators/NV.IND.TOTL.KD.ZG?per_page=1000","description":"Annual growth rate for industrial value added based on constant local currency.

Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the import volume indexes (lines 73) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nImport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-04T09:27:16.288Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:33:27.736Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:33:27.736Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6537317,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JPN_SP_POP_1524_MA_UN","name":"Japan: Population, aged 15-24, male","urlize_name":"Japan-Population-aged-15-24-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/JPN/indicators/SP.POP.1524.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 15-24, male is the total number of males age 15-24.\nPopulation, aged 15-24, male","created_at":"2013-05-18T15:21:33.204Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:33:27.726Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:33:27.726Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":278739,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CPV_NE_GDI_FTOT_CD","name":"Cape Verde: Gross fixed capital formation (current US$)","urlize_name":"Cape-Verde-Gross-fixed-capital-formation-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CPV/indicators/NE.GDI.FTOT.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Gross fixed capital formation (formerly gross domestic fixed investment) includes land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock, total","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:20:10.392Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:11:40.082Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:11:40.082Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":194960,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARM_MYS_PROP_6569_PRI_MA","name":"Armenia: proportion, 65-69, male, primary","urlize_name":"Armenia-proportion-65-69-male-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARM/indicators/MYS.PROP.6569.PRI.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 65-69, male, primary is the proportion of the male population age 65-69 with primary education.\nproportion, 65-69, male, primary","created_at":"2012-01-02T13:49:24.980Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:29:56.766Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:29:56.766Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6514886,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ESP_GFDD_DM_04","name":"Spain: Outstanding domestic public debt securities to GDP (%)","urlize_name":"Spain-Outstanding-domestic-public-debt-securities-to-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ESP/indicators/GFDD.DM.04?per_page=1000","description":"Total amount of domestic public debt securities (amounts outstanding) issued in domestic markets as a share of GDP.

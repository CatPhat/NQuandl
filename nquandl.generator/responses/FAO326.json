Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:50:38.695Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:31.339Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:31.339Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7643046,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_211SWITZERLAND116POTATOES","name":"Emissions Agriculture Crop Residues: Potatoes - Switzerland","urlize_name":"Emissions-Agriculture-Crop-Residues-Potatoes-Switzerland","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Emissions_Agriculture_Crop_Residues_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

In the cases where countries have not provided information through the questionnaire, FAO estimates annual production based on trade journal reports, statistical yearbooks or other sources.

The national distribution of land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data sets. The Agricultural Resources domain covers: Investment, Land and irrigation, Labour, Machinery, Fertilizers, Pesticides, Population. The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:51:54.926Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:35.144Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:35.144Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1996-12-31","to_date":"2002-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7851818,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_2AFGHANISTAN1621WRAPPINGPAPERS","name":"Forestry: Wrapping Papers - Afghanistan","urlize_name":"Forestry-Wrapping-Papers-Afghanistan","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

When data on number of tourists are not available, the number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members, is shown instead. Sources and collection methods for arrivals differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police, immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in hotels. Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries. The data on inbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals, not to the number of people traveling.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-01-05T07:46:35.343Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:36:15.477Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:36:15.477Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2273862,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"DOM_IC_FRM_CORR_CORR1","name":"Dominican Republic: Percent of firms expected to give gifts in meetings with tax officials","urlize_name":"Dominican-Republic-Percent-of-firms-expected-to-give-gifts-in-meetings-with-tax-officials","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/DOM/indicators/IC.FRM.CORR.CORR1?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms expected to give gifts or an informal payment in meetings with tax officials.

Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:16:21.885Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:07:42.498Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:07:42.498Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (m3)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7837514,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5400EUROPETOTAL2455006ROOTORTUBERHARVESTINGMACHINES","name":"Investment Machinery: Root or tuber harvesting machines - Europe + (Total)","urlize_name":"Investment-Machinery-Root-or-tuber-harvesting-machines-Europe-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Investment_Machinery_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Investment Domain in FAOSTAT includes: Capital stock, External assistance to agriculture, Machinery.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-04T22:22:55.559Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T07:03:05.075Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-18T07:03:05.075Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Total Population - Both sexes (1000)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7757831,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5817NETFOODIMPORTINGDEVELOPINGCOUNTRIESTOTAL95FLOUROFFONIO","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Flour of Fonio - Net Food Importing Developing Countries + (Total)","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Flour-of-Fonio-Net-Food-Importing-Developing-Countries-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-01-07T07:02:07.462Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T02:40:14.845Z","refreshed_at":"2014-11-22T02:40:14.845Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1963-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":309263,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ECU_NEGDISTKBCD","name":"Ecuador: Change in Inventories, current US$, millions","urlize_name":"Ecuador-Change-in-Inventories-current-US-millions","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ECU/indicators/NEGDISTKBCD?per_page=1000","description":"Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and \"work in progress.\" Data is in current US$, millions\nChange in Inventories, current US$, millions","created_at":"2012-01-05T06:33:52.358Z","updated_at":"2013-08-28T22:14:21.471Z","refreshed_at":"2013-08-28T22:14:21.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":261152,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_BN_CUR_GDPM_ZS","name":"Cameroon: Current account balance excluding net official capital grants (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Cameroon-Current-account-balance-excluding-net-official-capital-grants-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/BN.CUR.GDPM.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Current account balance is the sum of net exports of goods, services, net income, and net current transfers.

refer to insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances which may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids or other pests in or on their bodies.  The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit, and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.  Pesticide trade is the value of trade covering insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and others, as described by the Harmonised Coding System (HS) code 3808.  Differences between figures given for total exports and total imports at the world level may be due to several factors, e.g. the time lag between the dispatch of goods from exporting country and their arrival in the importing country; the use of different classification of the same product by different countries; or the fact that some countries supply data on general trade while others give data on special trade.\nHazardous pesticides imports (FAO, current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-10T07:52:32.793Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:00:35.978Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:00:35.978Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":462277,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MAR_AG_PRD_CROP_XD","name":"Morocco: Crop production index (2004-2006 = 100)","urlize_name":"Morocco-Crop-production-index-2004-2006-100","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MAR/indicators/AG.PRD.CROP.XD?per_page=1000","description":"Crop production index shows agricultural production for each year relative to the base period 2004-2006.

To obtain the elasticity, the log of profits (measured by return on assets) is regressed on the log of marginal costs. The estimated coefficient (computed from the first derivative of a trans-log cost function) is the elasticity. The rationale behind the indicator is that higher profits are achieved by more-efficient banks. Hence, the more negative the Boone indicator, the higher the degree of competition is because the effect of reallocation is stronger. Estimations of the Boone indicator in this database follow the methodology used by Schaeck and Čihák (2010) with a modification to use marginal costs instead of average costs. Regional estimates of the Boone indicator pool the bank data by regions (for more information, see Hay and Liu 1997; Boone 2001; Boone, Griffith, and Harrison 2005).

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users’ Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY “spectrum” is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.\nCombined polity score","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:12:02.668Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:59:46.997Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:59:46.997Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6594397,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PER_IS_ROD_SGAS_KT","name":"Peru: Road sector gasoline fuel consumption (kt of oil equivalent)","urlize_name":"Peru-Road-sector-gasoline-fuel-consumption-kt-of-oil-equivalent","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PER/indicators/IS.ROD.SGAS.KT?per_page=1000","description":"Gasoline is light hydrocarbon oil use in internal combustion engine such as motor vehicles, excluding aircraft.\nRoad sector gasoline fuel consumption (kt of oil equivalent)","created_at":"2013-05-21T11:39:50.615Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T17:42:43.475Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T17:42:43.475Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":359817,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GTM_MYS_PROP_65UP_NED_FE","name":"Guatemala: proportion, 65+, female, no education","urlize_name":"Guatemala-proportion-65-female-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GTM/indicators/MYS.PROP.65UP.NED.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 65+, female, no education is the proportion of the female population over age 65 with no education.\nproportion, 65+, female, no education","created_at":"2012-01-06T08:16:44.791Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:49.906Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:49.906Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":363679,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HKG_EN_ATM_CO2E_LF_ZS","name":"Hong Kong SAR, China: CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption (% of total)","urlize_name":"Hong-Kong-SAR-China-CO2-emissions-from-liquid-fuel-consumption-of-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HKG/indicators/EN.ATM.CO2E.LF.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Carbon dioxide emissions from liquid fuel consumption refer mainly to emissions from use of petroleum-derived fuels as an energy source.\nCO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption (% of total) ","created_at":"2012-01-06T10:20:14.034Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:50.945Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:37:50.945Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2156658,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NER_MYS_PROP_1564_PRI_FE","name":"Niger: proportion, 15-64, female, primary","urlize_name":"Niger-proportion-15-64-female-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NER/indicators/MYS.PROP.1564.PRI.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 15-64, female, primary is the proportion of the female population age 15-64 with primary education.\nproportion, 15-64, female, primary","created_at":"2012-08-08T23:58:55.409Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:55:04.454Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:55:04.454Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2593713,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"RUS_UIS_R_23_GPV_G2_F","name":"Russian Federation: Repeaters in secondary.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nCereal production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-05T17:01:06.874Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:56:14.799Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:56:14.799Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":260690,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_BAR_SEC_CMPT_2024_FE_ZS","name":"Cameroon: percentage of population (15+), 20-24, female, completed secondary","urlize_name":"Cameroon-percentage-of-population-15-20-24-female-completed-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/BAR.SEC.CMPT.2024.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 20-24, female, completed secondary is the percentage of females age 20-24 who have completed secondary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 20-24, female, completed secondary","created_at":"2012-01-04T06:26:08.236Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T07:34:11.596Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T07:34:11.596Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6515569,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ETH_DT_HPC_COMR_PV","name":"Ethiopia: Debt relief committed under HIPC initiative, cumulative US$ in end-2008 NPV terms","urlize_name":"Ethiopia-Debt-relief-committed-under-HIPC-initiative-cumulative-US-in-end-2008-NPV-terms","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ETH/indicators/DT.HPC.COMR.PV?per_page=1000","description":"Debt relief is committed as of the decision point (assuming full participation of creditors) under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

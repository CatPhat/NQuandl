This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters, headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.\nTertiary education, teachers (% female)","created_at":"2012-01-03T07:44:03.056Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:32:47.244Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:32:47.244Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1981-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2141074,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CAN_WP11647_2","name":"Canada: Saved for emergencies in the past year, male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Canada-Saved-for-emergencies-in-the-past-year-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CAN/indicators/WP11647.2?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved for emergencies or a time when they expect to have less income in the past 12 months (% male, age 15+)\nSaved for emergencies in the past year, male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T22:24:40.181Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:09:35.655Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:09:35.655Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2224988,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARM_WP11636_3","name":"Armenia: Account used to receive remittances , female (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Armenia-Account-used-to-receive-remittances-female-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARM/indicators/WP11636.3?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who used a formal account in the past 12 months to receive money from family members living elsewhere (% female, age 15+)\nAccount used to receive remittances , female (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T06:56:00.417Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:23.505Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:05:23.505Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2152019,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MWI_WP11659_9","name":"Malawi: Personally paid for agriculture insurance, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% who work in farming/fishing/forestry, age 15+)","urlize_name":"Malawi-Personally-paid-for-agriculture-insurance-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-who-work-in-farming-fishing-forestry-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MWI/indicators/WP11659.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who are farming, fishing or forestry workers and in the past 12 months have personally paid for crop, rainfall, or livestock insurance (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+)\nPersonally paid for agriculture insurance, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% who work in farming/fishing/forestry, age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T23:23:49.857Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:32:46.221Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:32:46.221Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2212028,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAN_WP11629_2_4","name":"Panama: 1-2 withdrawals from account in a typical month, young adults (% with an account,  age 15-24)","urlize_name":"Panama-1-2-withdrawals-from-account-in-a-typical-month-young-adults-with-an-account-age-15-24","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAN/indicators/WP11629.2.4?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make 1-2 withdrawals from their personal account(s) in a typical month.

Cement production is a multi-step process and CO2 is actually released from klinker production during the cement production process. The U.S. Department of Energy’s carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division’s World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Bureau of Mine’s Cement Manufacturing Data Set).  Carbon dioxide emissions, often calculated and reported as elemental carbon, were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average file chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds.  Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.  Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections.  Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning he fuels among benefitting countries.  The ratio of carbon dioxide per unit of energy shows carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted as a result of using one unit of energy in the process of production.\nCO2 emissions from cement production (thousand metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-06T02:47:41.507Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:54:27.006Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:54:27.006Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2009-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2185636,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CMR_WP11646_11","name":"Cameroon: Saved for future expenses in the past year, urban (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Cameroon-Saved-for-future-expenses-in-the-past-year-urban-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CMR/indicators/WP11646.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved for expenses in the future such as education, a wedding, or a big purchase in the past 12 months (% living in a rural area, age 15+)\nSaved for future expenses in the past year, urban (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T03:11:31.136Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:23:50.807Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:23:50.807Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2087105,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SWZ_MYS_POP_4549_NED_MA","name":"Swaziland: population in thousand, 45-49, male, no education","urlize_name":"Swaziland-population-in-thousand-45-49-male-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SWZ/indicators/MYS.POP.4549.NED.MA?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 45-49, male, no education is the total number of males age 45-49 (in thousands) with no education.\npopulation in thousand, 45-49, male, no education","created_at":"2012-08-08T17:43:10.570Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:32:47.782Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:32:47.782Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2224252,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ARM_WP11631_3_11","name":"Armenia: Retail store is main mode of deposit into account, urban (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Armenia-Retail-store-is-main-mode-of-deposit-into-account-urban-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ARM/indicators/WP11631.3.11?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to get cash (paper or coins) from their account(s) is over the counter at a retail store (% living in a rural area, age 15+, with a formal account)\nRetail store is main mode of deposit into account, urban (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T06:51:51.094Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:04.395Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:11:04.395Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2187184,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"OMN_UIS_REPP_1_G3_F","name":"Oman: Percentage of repeaters in primary.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data.

Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes.

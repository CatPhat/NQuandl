Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and \"work in progress.\" According to the 1993 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation.\nGross capital formation (annual % growth)","created_at":"2012-01-02T18:00:21.867Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.594Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.594Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2159205,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CHN_UIS_AY_SY","name":"China: Starting year of the academic year (Questionnaire A)","urlize_name":"China-Starting-year-of-the-academic-year-Questionnaire-A","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CHN/indicators/UIS.AY.SY?per_page=1000","description":"Starting year of the academic year (Questionnaire A)\nStarting year of the academic year (Questionnaire A)","created_at":"2012-08-09T00:18:35.839Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.675Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.675Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":391920,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"JAM_SP_POP_1215_TO_UN","name":"Jamaica: Population, aged 12-15, total","urlize_name":"Jamaica-Population-aged-12-15-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/JAM/indicators/SP.POP.1215.TO.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12-15, total is the total population age 12-15.\nPopulation, aged 12-15, total","created_at":"2012-01-07T00:46:45.333Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.732Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.732Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":357168,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GUY_SL_TLF_CACT_ZS","name":"Guyana: Labor participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15+)","urlize_name":"Guyana-Labor-participation-rate-total-of-total-population-ages-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GUY/indicators/SL.TLF.CACT.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.\nLabor participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15+)","created_at":"2012-01-06T06:48:04.455Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.711Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:13:40.711Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6490727,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_NE_GDI_FTOT_CN","name":"Uganda: Gross fixed capital formation (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Uganda-Gross-fixed-capital-formation-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/NE.GDI.FTOT.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Gross fixed capital formation (formerly gross domestic fixed investment) includes land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings.

For each dimension, a country is scored against specific criteria, using information available from the World Bank, IMF, UN, UNESCO, and WHO. A composite score for each dimension and an overall score combining all three dimensions are derived for each country on a scale of 0-100.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

Such expenditures include military and civil personnel, including retirement pensions of military personnel and social services for personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; military research and development; and military aid (in the military expenditures of the donor country).

The index has been normalized so that values run from 0 (no biodiversity potential) to 100 (maximum biodiversity potential).\nGEF benefits index for biodiversity (0 = no biodiversity potential to 100 = maximum)","created_at":"2012-01-09T11:22:11.112Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:08:14.366Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:08:14.366Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2093794,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TUN_WP11671_2","name":"Tunisia: Outstanding loan for funerals or weddings, male (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Tunisia-Outstanding-loan-for-funerals-or-weddings-male-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TUN/indicators/WP11671.2?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out for funerals or weddings (% male, age 15+)\nOutstanding loan for funerals or weddings, male (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:22:53.736Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:04:31.291Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:04:31.291Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2155735,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"ZWE_SP_POP_AG09_FE_UN","name":"Zimbabwe: Population, aged  9, female","urlize_name":"Zimbabwe-Population-aged-9-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/ZWE/indicators/SP.POP.AG09.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 9, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged  9, female","created_at":"2012-08-08T23:52:17.100Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:41:49.086Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:41:49.086Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":459467,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MAR_SP_POP_AG12_FE_UN","name":"Morocco: Population, aged 12, female","urlize_name":"Morocco-Population-aged-12-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MAR/indicators/SP.POP.AG12.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12, female refers to the female population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 12, female","created_at":"2012-01-10T02:41:20.475Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:28:44.778Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:28:44.778Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2118384,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLE_WP11645_3","name":"Sierra Leone: Saved any money in the past year, female (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Sierra-Leone-Saved-any-money-in-the-past-year-female-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLE/indicators/WP11645.3?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved or set aside any money in the past 12 months (% female, age 15+)\nSaved any money in the past year, female (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-08T20:34:52.030Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:55:43.038Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:55:43.038Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":412096,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KGZ_EN_ATM_CO2E_KD_GD","name":"Kyrgyz Republic: CO2 emissions (kg per 2000 US$ of GDP)","urlize_name":"Kyrgyz-Republic-CO2-emissions-kg-per-2000-US-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KGZ/indicators/EN.ATM.CO2E.KD.GD?per_page=1000","description":"Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement.

Total official flows are the sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country. Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor). UN agencies are United Nations and include the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), United Nations Regular Programme for Technical Assistance (UNTA), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Fund for Agricul­tural Development (IFAD), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Population Fund (UNPD), United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), and World Health Organization (WHO).

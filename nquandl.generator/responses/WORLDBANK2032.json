Private transactions are those undertaken by firms and individuals resident in the reporting country. Portfolio investment corresponds to bonds and equities.

Accordingly, the coverage of portfolio investment differs in these regards from the coverage of bank claims, which include indistinguishably export credit lending by banks. The bank claims data represent the net change in banks’ claims after adjustment to eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates. They are therefore a proxy for net flow data, but are not themselves a net flow figure. They differ in two further regards from other OECD data. First, they relate to loans by banks resident in countries which report quarterly to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the export volume indexes (lines 72) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.\nExport volume index (2000 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-05T08:56:00.975Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:51.380Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:51.380Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2000-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":470120,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MDV_SP_POP_AG19_MA_UN","name":"Maldives: Population, aged 19, male","urlize_name":"Maldives-Population-aged-19-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MDV/indicators/SP.POP.AG19.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 19, male refers to the male population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 19, male","created_at":"2012-01-10T09:46:55.485Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:51.580Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:51.580Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2221333,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SLV_SP_POP_1218_FE_UN","name":"El Salvador: Population, aged 12-18, female","urlize_name":"El-Salvador-Population-aged-12-18-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SLV/indicators/SP.POP.1218.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 12-18, female is the total number of females age 12-18.\nPopulation, aged 12-18, female","created_at":"2012-08-09T06:34:26.191Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:53.457Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:53.457Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2204511,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SDN_SP_POP_1116_MA_UN","name":"Sudan: Population, aged 11-16, male","urlize_name":"Sudan-Population-aged-11-16-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SDN/indicators/SP.POP.1116.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 11-16, male is the total number of males age 11-16.\nPopulation, aged 11-16, male","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:59:43.038Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:53.986Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:53.986Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":512399,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MRT_SP_POP_0510_MA_UN","name":"Mauritania: Population, aged 5-10, male","urlize_name":"Mauritania-Population-aged-5-10-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MRT/indicators/SP.POP.0510.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 5-10, male is the total number of males age 5-10.\nPopulation, aged 5-10, male","created_at":"2012-03-05T10:11:54.558Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:54.274Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:54.274Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":335657,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_DP_DOD_DLOA_CR_CG_CD","name":"Georgia: 059.Other accounts payable (PSDCG) US$","urlize_name":"Georgia-059-Other-accounts-payable-PSDCG-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/DP.DOD.DLOA.CR.CG.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Member Country\n059.Other accounts payable (PSDCG) US$","created_at":"2012-01-05T19:47:37.028Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:54.423Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T17:50:54.423Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-09-30","to_date":"2014-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6468399,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"TGO_DT_NFL_PROP_CD","name":"Togo: PPG, other private creditors (NFL, current US$)","urlize_name":"Togo-PPG-other-private-creditors-NFL-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/TGO/indicators/DT.NFL.PROP.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Public and publicly guaranteed other private credits from manufacturers, exporters, and other suppliers of goods, and bank credits covered by a guarantee of an export credit agency.

A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nGINI index","created_at":"2012-08-09T08:43:52.516Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:23:00.739Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:23:00.739Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1988-12-31","to_date":"1992-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2057713,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MNE_WP11656_8","name":"Montenegro: Outstanding loan to purchase a home , income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Montenegro-Outstanding-loan-to-purchase-a-home-income-quintiles-I-lowest-and-II-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MNE/indicators/WP11656.8?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who currently have a loan they took out to purchase their home or apartment (% in the first (lowest) and second income quintiles (0-40th percentile), age 15+)\nOutstanding loan to purchase a home , income quintiles I (lowest) and II (% age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-07T20:51:45.279Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T21:53:39.201Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T21:53:39.201Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2203057,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CZE_WP11630_2_9","name":"Czech Republic: Bank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Czech-Republic-Bank-teller-is-main-mode-of-withdrawal-from-account-income-quintiles-III-IV-and-V-highest-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CZE/indicators/WP11630.2.9?per_page=1000","description":"Adults whose usual mode of access to put cash (paper or coins) into their account(s) is over the counter in a branch of one's bank or financial institution (% in the third, fourth, and fifth (highest) income quintiles (41st-100th percentile), age 15+, with a formal account)\nBank teller is main mode of withdrawal from account, income quintiles III, IV, and V (highest)  (% with an account,  age 15+)","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:50:11.050Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T14:34:53.457Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T14:34:53.457Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2118219,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UZB_WP11628_3_10","name":"Uzbekistan: 3+ deposits into account in a typical month, rural (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Uzbekistan-3-deposits-into-account-in-a-typical-month-rural-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UZB/indicators/WP11628.3.10?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make 3 or more deposits into their personal account(s) in a typical month.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-08-08T18:48:04.406Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:12:49.791Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T15:12:49.791Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2060172,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"GEO_WP11629_3_3","name":"Georgia: 3+ withdrawals from account in a typical month, female (% with an account,  age 15+)","urlize_name":"Georgia-3-withdrawals-from-account-in-a-typical-month-female-with-an-account-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/GEO/indicators/WP11629.3.3?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who make 3 or more withdrawals from their personal account(s) in a typical month.

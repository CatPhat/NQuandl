The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:53:51.368Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:02.925Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T19:01:02.925Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7643496,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_248YUGOSLAVSFR767COTTONLINT","name":"Prices Archive: Cotton lint - Yugoslav SFR","urlize_name":"Prices-Archive-Cotton-lint-Yugoslav-SFR","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/PricesArchive_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: 1) Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate).

Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T15:35:56.197Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T00:14:26.421Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T00:14:26.421Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price (LCU/tonne) (LCU)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7823930,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_54DENMARK1352SEEDTREATMFUNGICIDESTOTAL","name":"Resources Pesticides Use: Seed Treatm Fungicides + (Total) - Denmark","urlize_name":"Resources-Pesticides-Use-Seed-Treatm-Fungicides-Total-Denmark","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_Pesticides_Use_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some 200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the world's value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International Dollar Prices). 2) Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries. The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T19:18:28.918Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T00:16:21.827Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T00:16:21.827Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price (LCU/tonne) (LCU)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7708167,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_299OCCUPIEDPALESTINIANTERRITORY2071BOVINEMEATTOTAL","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Bovine Meat + (Total) - Occupied Palestinian Territory","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Bovine-Meat-Total-Occupied-Palestinian-Territory","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

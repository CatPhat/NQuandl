Primary. Never in school. Quintile 1 is the percentage of quintile 1 out-of-school primary-school-age children who have never attended school and are not likely to enter school in the future. Since no survey can say definitively that a school-age person will never attend school, this is a probabilistic indicator. The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.\nDHS: Typology of out-of-school children. Primary.

All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The \"\"international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nNon-food production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-02T17:52:23.196Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:04:51.928Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:04:51.928Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":374726,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HUN_MYS_POP_15UP_SEC_MF","name":"Hungary: population in thousand, 15+, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Hungary-population-in-thousand-15-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HUN/indicators/MYS.POP.15UP.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 15+, total, secondary is the total number of people over age 15 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 15+, total, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T15:20:58.952Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:04:54.678Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:04:54.678Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":203537,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BDI_BAR_TER_SCHL_2024","name":"Burundi: average years of tertiary schooling, 20-24, total","urlize_name":"Burundi-average-years-of-tertiary-schooling-20-24-total","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BDI/indicators/BAR.TER.SCHL.2024?per_page=1000","description":"Average years of tertiary schooling, 20-24, total is the average years of tertiary education completed among people age 20-24. \naverage years of tertiary schooling, 20-24, total","created_at":"2012-01-02T18:10:34.317Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:40:08.973Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:40:08.973Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2041813,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"VCT_UIS_E_23_GPV_G4_F","name":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Enrolment in secondary.

To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-05T23:09:42.116Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:48:37.120Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:48:37.120Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1962-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6722452,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"UGA_SL_TLF_CACT_FM_ZS","name":"Uganda: Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%)","urlize_name":"Uganda-Ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation-rate","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/UGA/indicators/SL.TLF.CACT.FM.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.\nRatio of female to male labor force participation rate (%)","created_at":"2013-05-24T08:04:02.790Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T06:48:37.203Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T06:48:37.203Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":308453,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"EGY_FS_AST_DOMS_GD_ZS","name":"Egypt, Arab Rep.: Domestic credit provided by banking sector (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"Egypt-Arab-Rep-Domestic-credit-provided-by-banking-sector-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/EGY/indicators/FS.AST.DOMS.GD.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Domestic credit provided by the banking sector includes all credit to various sectors on a gross basis, with the exception of credit to the central government, which is net.

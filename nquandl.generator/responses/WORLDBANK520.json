Note that this measures the theoretical ability to use mobile cellular services if one has a cellular telephone and a subscription.  \nPopulation coverage of mobile cellular telephony (%)","created_at":"2012-08-09T07:08:02.624Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:28:55.319Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:28:55.319Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2002-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":282044,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CUB_SE_PRM_UNER","name":"Cuba: Children out of school, primary","urlize_name":"Cuba-Children-out-of-school-primary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CUB/indicators/SE.PRM.UNER?per_page=1000","description":"Out-of-school children of primary school age.

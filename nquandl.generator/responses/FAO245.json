The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption.

Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T00:46:17.418Z","updated_at":"2013-07-26T00:40:49.340Z","refreshed_at":"2013-07-26T00:40:49.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1994-12-31","to_date":"2000-12-31","column_names":["Year","Use (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7686740,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_33CANADA499LEMONJUICECONCENTRATED","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Lemon juice, concentrated - Canada","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Lemon-juice-concentrated-Canada","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

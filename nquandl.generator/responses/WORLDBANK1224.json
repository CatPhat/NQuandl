The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  ”international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country.  Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients.  Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nCereal production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-03T23:06:25.295Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:00:26.402Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:00:26.402Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6483838,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BWA_WP11654_1","name":"Botswana: Loan from an employer in the past year (% age 15+)","urlize_name":"Botswana-Loan-from-an-employer-in-the-past-year-age-15","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BWA/indicators/WP11654.1?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who borrowed any money in the past 12 months from an employer (% age 15+)\nLoan from an employer in the past year (% age 15+)","created_at":"2013-05-15T07:27:48.071Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:17:40.128Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T18:17:40.128Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6483629,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BWA_WP11645_5","name":"Botswana: Saved any money in the past year, older adults (% age 25+)","urlize_name":"Botswana-Saved-any-money-in-the-past-year-older-adults-age-25","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BWA/indicators/WP11645.5?per_page=1000","description":"Adults who saved or set aside any money in the past 12 months (% age 25+)\nSaved any money in the past year, older adults (% age 25+)","created_at":"2013-05-15T07:25:54.211Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T11:23:12.510Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T11:23:12.510Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2011-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":243664,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CAF_AG_YLD_MLT_KG","name":"Central African Republic: Millet yield (kg per hectare)","urlize_name":"Central-African-Republic-Millet-yield-kg-per-hectare","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CAF/indicators/AG.YLD.MLT.KG?per_page=1000","description":"Millet yield, measured as kilograms per hectare of harvested land.

Private transactions are those undertaken by firms and individuals resident in the reporting country. Portfolio investment corresponds to bonds and equities. Inflows into emerging countries’ stocks markets, are, however, heavily understated. Accordingly, the coverage of portfolio investment differs in these regards from the coverage of bank claims, which include indistinguishably export credit lending by banks. The bank claims data represent the net change in banks’ claims after adjustment to eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates. They are therefore a proxy for net flow data, but are not themselves a net flow figure. They differ in two further regards from other OECD data. First, they relate to loans by banks resident in countries which report quarterly to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Secondly, no adjustment has been made to exclude short-term claims.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.

Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.

This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of female literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100. \nLiteracy rate, adult female (% of females ages 15 and above)","created_at":"2012-01-06T08:30:28.724Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:57:52.479Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:57:52.479Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1994-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":374967,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HUN_MYS_POP_4549_SEC_MF","name":"Hungary: population in thousand, 45-49, total, secondary","urlize_name":"Hungary-population-in-thousand-45-49-total-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HUN/indicators/MYS.POP.4549.SEC.MF?per_page=1000","description":"Population in thousand, 45-49, total, secondary is the total number of people age 45-49 (in thousands) with secondary education.\npopulation in thousand, 45-49, total, secondary","created_at":"2012-01-06T15:24:46.624Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T22:58:28.251Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T22:58:28.251Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":366475,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_SL_SRV_EMPL_ZS","name":"Croatia: Employment in services (% of total employment)","urlize_name":"Croatia-Employment-in-services-of-total-employment","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/SL.SRV.EMPL.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Employees are people who work for a public or private employer and receive remuneration in wages, salary, commission, tips, piece rates, or pay in kind.

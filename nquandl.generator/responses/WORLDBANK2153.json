For each dimension, a country is scored against specific criteria, using information available from the World Bank, IMF, UN, UNESCO, and WHO. A composite score for each dimension and an overall score combining all three dimensions are derived for each country on a scale of 0-100.

A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\nGINI index","created_at":"2012-01-10T11:49:24.755Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:32:01.879Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:32:01.879Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1984-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":406225,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"KEN_SP_POP_AG16_MA_UN","name":"Kenya: Population, aged 16, male","urlize_name":"Kenya-Population-aged-16-male","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/KEN/indicators/SP.POP.AG16.MA.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 16, male refers to the male population at the specified age.\nPopulation, aged 16, male","created_at":"2012-01-07T06:48:45.310Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:32:03.436Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:32:03.436Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":473242,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEX_SP_POP_1316_FE_UN","name":"Mexico: Population, aged 13-16, female","urlize_name":"Mexico-Population-aged-13-16-female","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MEX/indicators/SP.POP.1316.FE.UN?per_page=1000","description":"Population, age 13-16, female is the total number of females age 13-16.\nPopulation, aged 13-16, female","created_at":"2012-01-10T12:01:20.236Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:32:03.857Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:32:03.857Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2015-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2252742,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"THA_DT_GRE_OFFT","name":"Thailand: Average grant element on new external debt commitments, official (%)","urlize_name":"Thailand-Average-grant-element-on-new-external-debt-commitments-official","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/THA/indicators/DT.GRE.OFFT?per_page=1000","description":"The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed.

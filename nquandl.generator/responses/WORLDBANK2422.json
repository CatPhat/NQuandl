GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-08T23:58:06.254Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:24.502Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:24.502Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1973-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6590548,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"OEC_NE_TRD_GNFS_ZS","name":"High income: OECD: Trade (% of GDP)","urlize_name":"High-income-OECD-Trade-of-GDP","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/OEC/indicators/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of gross domestic product.\nTrade (% of GDP)","created_at":"2013-05-21T06:31:16.215Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:24.675Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:24.675Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2194238,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"CZE_UIS_THAGE_3_A_GPV","name":"Czech Republic: Entrance age of 3A upper secondary","urlize_name":"Czech-Republic-Entrance-age-of-3A-upper-secondary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/CZE/indicators/UIS.thAge.3.A.GPV?per_page=1000","description":"Entrance age of 3A upper secondary is the age at which students would enter ISCED 3A upper secondary education, assuming they had started at the official entrance age for the lowest level of education, had studied full-time throughout and had progressed through the system without repeating or skipping a grade.\nEntrance age of 3A upper secondary","created_at":"2012-08-09T04:02:10.045Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:24.959Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T20:41:24.959Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2014-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":471191,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MEA_SL_TLF_TOTL_FE_ZS","name":"Middle East & North Africa (all income levels): Labor force, female (% of total labor force)","urlize_name":"Middle-East-North-Africa-all-income-levels-Labor-force-female-of-total-labor-force","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MEA/indicators/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Female labor force as a percentage of the total show the extent to which women are active in the labor force.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

Where data are unavailable, FAO repeats historical figures until new information is found.","created_at":"2013-07-06T06:51:06.679Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T20:46:33.303Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T20:46:33.303Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7816338,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_50CYPRUS1380OTHERPHOSPHATEFERTIL","name":"Resources Fertilizers Archive: Other Phosphate Fertil - Cyprus","urlize_name":"Resources-Fertilizers-Archive-Other-Phosphate-Fertil-Cyprus","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Resources_FertilizersArchive_E_Asia_1.zip","description":"Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T04:14:14.403Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:54:46.307Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:54:46.307Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Stock Variation (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7652953,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_47COOKISLANDS1181BEEHIVES","name":"Production Livestock: Beehives - Cook Islands","urlize_name":"Production-Livestock-Beehives-Cook-Islands","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Production_Livestock_E_Oceania_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Production domain covers quantity produced, producer price, value at farmgate, area harvested, yield per hectare.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-06T01:10:13.112Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T07:50:51.646Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-26T07:50:51.646Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2009-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Import Value (1000 US$)","Export Value (1000 US$)","Import Quantity (Kg)","Export Quantity (Kg)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7676049,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_133MALI238CAKEOFSOYBEANS","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Cake of Soybeans - Mali","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Cake-of-Soybeans-Mali","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Africa_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T05:07:21.095Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:56:17.507Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:56:17.507Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Import Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Seed (1000 tonnes)","Processed (1000 tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7851525,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_220TRINIDADANDTOBAGO1654MECHANICALWOODPULP","name":"Forestry: Mechanical Wood Pulp - Trinidad and Tobago","urlize_name":"Forestry-Mechanical-Wood-Pulp-Trinidad-and-Tobago","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Forestry_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"FAOSTAT-Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous forest products, primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it.

The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item indices. 3) Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices, also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.","created_at":"2013-06-14T20:29:39.358Z","updated_at":"2014-01-13T22:48:59.315Z","refreshed_at":"2014-01-13T22:48:59.315Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1969-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Producer Price Index (2004-2006 = 100) ()"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7692901,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_157NICARAGUA498LEMONJUICESINGLESTRENGTH","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Lemon juice, single strength - Nicaragua","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Lemon-juice-single-strength-Nicaragua","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

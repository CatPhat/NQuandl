Main activity producers  (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.\nCO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons)","created_at":"2012-01-04T14:06:56.943Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:40.841Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:10:40.841Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1971-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2162590,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"AUT_UIS_E_56_F200","name":"Austria: Enrolment in humanities and arts.

All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The \"\"international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"\"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published.  The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis.  Aggregates are the sum of available data.\nNon-food production index (gross, 1999-2001 = 100)","created_at":"2012-01-05T22:34:35.347Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:12:50.009Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:12:50.009Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6553902,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"LKA_IC_FRM_OBS_OBST4","name":"Sri Lanka: Percent of firms choosing corruption as their biggest obstacle","urlize_name":"Sri-Lanka-Percent-of-firms-choosing-corruption-as-their-biggest-obstacle","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/LKA/indicators/IC.FRM.OBS.OBST4?per_page=1000","description":"Percent of firms that chose corruption as the biggest obstacle faced by this establishment.

It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.\nInternational migrant stock (% of population)","created_at":"2012-01-02T15:18:45.867Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:53:46.246Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:53:46.246Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":462858,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MAR_DT_AMT_DECT_CD","name":"Morocco: Principal repayments, Total (current US$)","urlize_name":"Morocco-Principal-repayments-Total-current-US","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MAR/indicators/DT.AMT.DECT.CD?per_page=1000","description":"Principal repayments, total (AMT, current U.S. dollars).  \nPrincipal repayments, Total (current US$)","created_at":"2012-01-10T03:49:08.533Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:24:35.202Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:24:35.202Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1999-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2109476,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BOL_SAONLY_OVERLAP_SA_Q1","name":"Bolivia: % of 1st 20% population  only receiving All Social Safety Nets","urlize_name":"Bolivia-of-1st-20-population-only-receiving-All-Social-Safety-Nets","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BOL/indicators/saonly.overlap_sa_q1?per_page=1000","description":"It presents the % of 1st 20% population only receiving All Social Safety Nets\n% of 1st 20% population  only receiving All Social Safety Nets","created_at":"2012-08-08T19:50:29.240Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T15:14:51.295Z","refreshed_at":"2014-08-27T15:14:51.295Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2049799,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"MYS_IC_FRM_WRKF_WK4","name":"Malaysia: Number of permanent unskilled production workers","urlize_name":"Malaysia-Number-of-permanent-unskilled-production-workers","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/MYS/indicators/IC.FRM.WRKF.WK4?per_page=1000","description":"Number of permanent unskilled production workers.

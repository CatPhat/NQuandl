The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.","created_at":"2013-07-03T01:45:36.838Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T23:04:50.923Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T23:04:50.923Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Stock Variation (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (tonnes)","Seed (tonnes)","Waste (tonnes)","Processed (tonnes)","Food (tonnes)","Other Util (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7729417,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_273MONTENEGRO274OILOFOLIVERESIDUES","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Oil of Olive Residues - Montenegro","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Oil-of-Olive-Residues-Montenegro","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Europe_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption.

On the utilisation side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.","created_at":"2013-07-03T00:17:47.825Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:05:11.980Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-25T13:05:11.980Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Export Quantity (1000 tonnes)","Domestic supply quantity (1000 tonnes)","Food (1000 tonnes)","Other Util (1000 tonnes)","Food supply quantity (kg/capita/yr) (Kg)","Food supply (kcal/capita/day) (kcal/capita/day)","Protein supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)","Fat supply quantity (g/capita/day) (g/capita/day)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7695051,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_191SAINTVINCENTANDTHEGRENADINES519APPLEJUICECONCENTRATED","name":"Trade Crops Livestock: Apple juice, concentrated - Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","urlize_name":"Trade-Crops-Livestock-Apple-juice-concentrated-Saint-Vincent-and-the-Grenadines","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/Trade_Crops_Livestock_E_Americas_1.zip","description":"The Agricultural Trade domain covers detailed food and agriculture trade data: Export/Import quantity, Export/Import unit value, Export/Import Value, Trade matrix.

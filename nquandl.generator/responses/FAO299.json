The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on water and soil conditions.","created_at":"2013-07-05T23:45:39.572Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T18:48:55.028Z","refreshed_at":"2014-09-17T18:48:55.028Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1961-12-31","to_date":"2001-12-31","column_names":["Year","Production Quantity (tonnes)","Import Quantity (tonnes)","Export Quantity (tonnes)","Prices Paid by Farmers (LCU/Mt)","Consumption (tonnes)"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7789726,"source_id":863,"source_code":"FAO","code":"FAO_5404WESTERNEUROPETOTAL2914VEGETABLEOILSTOTAL","name":"Food Balance Sheets: Vegetable Oils + (Total) - Western Europe + (Total)","urlize_name":"Food-Balance-Sheets-Vegetable-Oils-Total-Western-Europe-Total","display_url":"http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/Downloads/zip_files/FoodBalanceSheets_E_All_Area_Groups_1.zip","description":"A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

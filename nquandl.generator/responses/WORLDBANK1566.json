It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.

Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent. The grant element of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. Loans from major regional development banks--African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was the practice in earlier reports. LDOD is the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.  The denominator is the sum of total goods and service exports (per the balance of payments account) and workers' remittances (per the balance of payments account).  \nDebt on Concessional terms to export ratio (% of exports)","created_at":"2012-03-05T13:01:00.155Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T21:58:34.792Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-18T21:58:34.792Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2011-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6585584,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NPL_MYS_PROP_1564_NED_FE","name":"Nepal: proportion, 15-64, female, no education","urlize_name":"Nepal-proportion-15-64-female-no-education","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/NPL/indicators/MYS.PROP.1564.NED.FE?per_page=1000","description":"Proportion, 15-64, female, no education is the proportion of the female population age 15-64 with no education.\nproportion, 15-64, female, no education","created_at":"2013-05-21T04:52:23.098Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:30:37.212Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T18:30:37.212Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2050-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":236479,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"BRB_BAR_TER_CMPT_7074_FE_ZS","name":"Barbados: percentage of population (15+), 70-74, female, completed tertiary","urlize_name":"Barbados-percentage-of-population-15-70-74-female-completed-tertiary","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/BRB/indicators/BAR.TER.CMPT.7074.FE.ZS?per_page=1000","description":"Percentage of population, 70-74, female, completed tertiary is the percentage of females age 70-74 who have completed tertiary education.\npercentage of population (15+), 70-74, female, completed tertiary","created_at":"2012-01-03T08:35:06.120Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:36:39.703Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:36:39.703Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":370926,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"HRV_GC_REV_XGRT_CN","name":"Croatia: Revenue, excluding grants (current LCU)","urlize_name":"Croatia-Revenue-excluding-grants-current-LCU","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/HRV/indicators/GC.REV.XGRT.CN?per_page=1000","description":"Revenue is cash receipts from taxes, social contributions, and other revenues such as fines, fees, rent, and income from property or sales.

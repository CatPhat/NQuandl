The database covers the main aggregates in the national accounts, such as GDP, income, saving, value added by industry, household spending and government expenditure, along with the relationships between these.  The database also includes detailed statistics for institutional sectors (including the rest of the world), comprising the production account, the generation of income account, the allocation of primary income account, the secondary distribution of income account, the use of disposable income account, the capital account and the financial account, if they are compiled by countries.. Different series numbers (column “Series”) are used to store different time-series versions of national accounts statistics. Series numbers with two digits (10,20) refer to data compiled following the 1968 SNA national accounts methodology, while series numbers with three digits (100, 200, etc) refer to data compiled using the 1993 SNA national accounts methodology, and series numbers with four digits (1000, 1100, etc) refer to data compiled using the 2008 SNA national accounts methodology. In addition to different methodologies, different series numbers are used when data are reported in different currencies, fiscal years, or by different sources. Furthermore, data are stored under a new series number whenever there are significant changes in compilation practices which make the time series no longer comparable.","created_at":"2014-02-21T19:57:31.729Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T19:57:31.972Z","refreshed_at":"2014-02-21T19:57:31.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1997-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Date","Alcoholic beverages; tobacco and narcotics","Clothing and footwear","Housing; water; electricity; gas and other fuels","Furnishings; household equipment and routine maintenance of the house","Health","Communication","Recreation and culture","Education","Restaurants and hotels","Miscellaneous goods and services","Equals: Household final consumption expenditure in domestic market","Food and non-alcoholic beverages","Transport"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":11300105,"source_id":5449,"source_code":"UNDATA","code":"IFS_FPOS_GBR","name":"Funding Position - UK","urlize_name":"Funding-Position-UK","display_url":null,"description":"International Financial Statistics (IFS) is a major source of statistics on all aspects of domestic and international finance.

The database is updated in December of each year. The database covers the main aggregates in the national accounts, such as GDP, income, saving, value added by industry, household spending and government expenditure, along with the relationships between these.  The database also includes detailed statistics for institutional sectors (including the rest of the world), comprising the production account, the generation of income account, the allocation of primary income account, the secondary distribution of income account, the use of disposable income account, the capital account and the financial account, if they are compiled by countries.. Different series numbers (column “Series”) are used to store different time-series versions of national accounts statistics. Series numbers with two digits (10,20) refer to data compiled following the 1968 SNA national accounts methodology, while series numbers with three digits (100, 200, etc) refer to data compiled using the 1993 SNA national accounts methodology, and series numbers with four digits (1000, 1100, etc) refer to data compiled using the 2008 SNA national accounts methodology. In addition to different methodologies, different series numbers are used when data are reported in different currencies, fiscal years, or by different sources. Furthermore, data are stored under a new series number whenever there are significant changes in compilation practices which make the time series no longer comparable.","created_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:13.389Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:28.024Z","refreshed_at":"2014-02-21T19:55:28.000Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1970-12-31","to_date":"1979-12-31","column_names":["Date","GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT","Plus: Property income - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Property income - from the rest of the world","Less: Property income - to the rest of the world","Equals: GROSS NATIONAL INCOME","Less: Final consumption expenditure / Actual final consumption","Less: Gross capital formation","Less: Consumption of fixed capital","Equals: NET NATIONAL INCOME","Plus: Compensation of employees - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Compensation of employees - from the rest of the world","Less: Compensation of employees - to the rest of the world","Sum of Compensation of employees and property income - from and to the rest of the world; net","Plus: Sum of Compensation of employees and property income - from the rest of the world","Less: Sum of Compensation of employees and property income - to the rest of the world"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9781531,"source_id":5449,"source_code":"UNDATA","code":"NAE_GVAKD_BEN","name":"GVA By Sector - Constant 2005 Prices, US Dollars - Benin","urlize_name":"GVA-By-Sector-Constant-2005-Prices-US-Dollars-Benin","display_url":null,"description":"Benin Gross Value Added by Kind of Economic Activity at constant (2005) prices - US dollars.

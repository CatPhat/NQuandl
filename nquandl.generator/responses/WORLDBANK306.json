Excluded are civil defense and current expenditures for previous military activities, such as for veterans' benefits, demobilization, conversion, and destruction of weapons. This definition cannot be applied for all countries, however, since that would require much more detailed information than is available about what is included in military budgets and off-budget military expenditure items. (For example, military budgets might or might not cover civil defense, reserves and auxiliary forces, police and paramilitary forces, dual-purpose forces such as military and civilian police, military grants in kind, pensions for military personnel, and social security contributions paid by one part of government to another.)\nMilitary expenditure (% of central government expenditure)","created_at":"2013-05-19T00:38:28.356Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T05:24:50.852Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T05:24:50.852Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6450851,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"SWE_SH_MMR_DTHS","name":"Sweden: Number of maternal deaths","urlize_name":"Sweden-Number-of-maternal-deaths","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/SWE/indicators/SH.MMR.DTHS?per_page=1000","description":"Maternal mortality deaths is the number of women who die during pregnancy and childbirth.\nNumber of maternal deaths","created_at":"2013-05-14T14:12:13.539Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T19:17:02.215Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T19:17:02.215Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2209410,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"PAK_SP_POP_AG03_FE_IN","name":"Pakistan: Age population, age 03, female, interpolated","urlize_name":"Pakistan-Age-population-age-03-female-interpolated","display_url":"http://api.worldbank.org/countries/PAK/indicators/SP.POP.AG03.FE.IN?per_page=1000","description":"Age population, age 03, female, interpolated\nAge population, age 03, female, interpolated","created_at":"2012-08-09T05:25:57.926Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T22:41:23.222Z","refreshed_at":"2015-02-19T22:41:23.222Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2170978,"source_id":66,"source_code":"WORLDBANK","code":"NER_UIS_DR_1_G4_M","name":"Niger: Drop-out rate.

When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available.
